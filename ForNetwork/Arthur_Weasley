{{Quote|Fascinating, Ingenious, really how many ways [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] have found ways of getting along without [[magic]].|Arthur Weasley's fascination with Muggles and their technology|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
'''Arthur Weasley''' (b. [[6 February]],&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt; [[1950]])&lt;ref name="PM-DOB" /&gt; was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]]&lt;ref name="blood" /&gt; [[Wizardkind|wizard]] in the employ of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], as well as a member of the second [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He was a staunch believer in the equality of all [[magic]]al and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] folk and was the head of the [[Weasley family]].

Arthur was born to [[Septimus Weasley|Septimus]] and [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella Weasley]] (née [[House of Black|Black]]) and had [[Arthur Weasley's brothers|two brothers]]. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1961]]-[[1968]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house. Soon after graduating, Arthur married [[Molly Weasley|Molly Prewett]]. During the [[First Wizarding War]], he and Molly had seven children: sons [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], as well as their daughter [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. He was not a member of the Order of the Phoenix during this period, and it is unknown if he participated in any way in the First Wizarding War. At some point after graduating from Hogwarts, Arthur began working for the Ministry, in the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]].

In [[1996]], he was promoted to head of the [[Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects]] by the new [[Minister for Magic]], [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]. When the [[Second Wizarding War]] began, Arthur joined the Order. While guarding the [[Department of Mysteries]], he was [[Attack on Arthur Weasley|attacked]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s pet snake [[Nagini]], but he made a full recovery. Arthur participated in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] ([[1997]]) and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] ([[1998]]), in which he suffered the devastating loss of his [[Fred Weasley|son]]; however, he survived the war.

After the war, he saw his family expand even further with the addition of twelve grandchildren, through the marriage of many of his surviving children and eventually named [[Head of Department]].&lt;ref name="WU SU" /&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life {{c|1950-1968}}===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Molly Weasley|[[Fat Lady|She]] gave me such a telling-off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning —|Bill Weasley|What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning?|Your father and I had been for a night-time stroll.|Molly discussing her and Arthur's time at Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Arthur Weasley was born on [[6 February]]&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-birthdays.html Mugglenet - JKR Birthday Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[1950]]&lt;ref name="PM-DOB"&gt;{{PM}} - [https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/arthur-weasley Explore the story: Arthur Weasley]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Septimus Weasley|Septimus]] and [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella Weasley]] (née [[House of Black|Black]]).&lt;ref&gt;Although it has never been directly confirmed that Septimus and Cedrella are Arthur's parents, this can be inferred based on [[Sirius Black]]'s statement in Ch. 6 of {{OOTP}} that Arthur was "something like [his] second cousin once removed." The [[House of Black|Black family tree]] establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both [[Orion Black|Orion]] and [[Walburga Black]], Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree because both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown. See also this [[Talk:Cedrella Black|talk page]] and an [http://www.hplex.info/essays/essay-black-family-tree.html HPL essay] for more information. Additionally, the Gobstones with Charlie Weasley activity in {{HM}} states Charlie's grandmother is named Cedrella Weasley.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was disowned for marrying a "[[blood traitor]]," as her family believed strongly in the notion of [[pure-blood]] supremacy. Arthur had [[Arthur Weasley's brothers|two brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://web.archive.org/web/20120205110828/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=7 Extra Stuff: The Weasley Family]" at {{JKRS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1961]]-[[1968]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. In his third year in [[1963]], he may have chosen to take [[Muggle Studies]], due to his interest in [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s. While at school, he met and began dating fellow Gryffindor [[Molly Weasley|Molly Prewett]]. Arthur got caught out of bed by the school caretaker [[Apollyon Pringle]] after he and Molly went for a night-time stroll one evening and was severely punished.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

===First Wizarding War {{c|1968-1981}}===
{{Dialogue|Molly Weasley|It's all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so they're rushing all sorts of decisions they'd normally take time over. It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and centre —|Ginny Weasley|Including you and Dad.|[[Molly Weasley]] reflecting on her marriage to Arthur|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:The Burrow.png|250px|thumb|left|The Burrow, located on the outskirts of [[Ottery St Catchpole]]]]
Shortly after graduating from Hogwarts, Arthur and Molly married. Their marriage was rather rushed, as [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was gaining power during that time and the [[First Wizarding War]] began.&lt;ref name="marriage"&gt;{{HBP|B|5}} - ""It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and centre —” “Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly."&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur was not a member of the first [[Order of the Phoenix]]. It is unknown if he was otherwise involved in the war, although he was familiar with the [[Death Eaters]]' use of the [[Imperius Curse]] and the trouble it caused the [[Ministry of Magic]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{GOF|B|14}} - "“Ah, yes,” said Moody appreciatively. “Your father would know that one. Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.”"&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the war, he and Molly had seven children: [[William Weasley|Bill]] in late [[1970]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] in [[1972]], [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] in [[1976]], twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] in [[1978]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] in [[1980]], and the first daughter to be born into the Weasley family in generations, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], in [[1981]].

The war ended soon after Ginny's birth, but not before Arthur's brothers-in-law [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], both Order members, were killed by [[Death Eaters]].&lt;ref name="OTP"&gt;{{OOTP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur was upset when some Death Eaters, such as [[Lucius Malfoy]], were able to escape punishment by claiming that they had been under the [[Imperius Curse]]. Arthur believed they were lying, and he and Lucius were hostile towards one another whenever they crossed paths.

===Between the wars {{c|1981-1995}}===
At some point between his graduation from Hogwarts and [[1992]], Arthur gained employment in the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. He also purchased a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[car]], a [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]], and bewitched it to make it [[Flight|fly]]; in order to do so, he made sure to include a loophole in a law he wrote for the Ministry: as long as he was not ''intending'' to fly the car, it would be legal. The car was part of Arthur's substantial personal collection of Muggle artefacts, which he kept in a [[Arthur Weasley's shed|shed]] and included [[plug]]s and [[Battery|batteries]].&lt;ref name="COS"&gt;{{COS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point in either [[1985]] or [[1986]], Arthur walked in on his twin sons attempting to make an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with five-year old Ronald and, in Ron's own words, "went mental". Precisely what happened was never elaborated on, but it was the only time Arthur was ever seen to have been as angry as his wife and it left Fred feeling "his left buttock has never been the same" for years afterwards. 

Arthur and Molly visited Hogwarts on at least two [[Christmas]]es in the [[1980s]], when Charlie was attending Hogwarts. During these visits, Arthur met [[Jacob's sibling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{HM|1|Christmas at Hogwarts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{HM|3|THE GIFT OF GRATITUDE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Chamber of Secrets====
{{Quote|We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, [[Lucius Malfoy|Malfoy]].|Arthur defending his family's beliefs against Lucius Malfoy|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Arthur work cos.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Arthur greeting his family after returning from work]]
In [[1992]], Ron, Fred, and George borrowed their father's car to rescue [[Harry Potter]] from [[4 Privet Drive|Privet Drive]], after not receiving letters from him all summer.  When Arthur returned to [[the Burrow]] after a night of Ministry raids, he was pleased to find out the car could indeed fly. That was until he caught his wife's eye; he then poorly reprimanded the boys for doing so. When asked if he had found anything during the raids, he responded that they had only found a bunch of [[Shrinking key|shrinking door-key]]s and a [[biting kettle]]. He was also introduced to Harry Potter and asked him about [[rubber duck]]s, due to his fascination with muggles.&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter2-movie-screencaps.com-2858.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Arthur's confrontation with Lucius Malfoy in [[Flourish and Blotts]]]]
A few days later, the family, as well as Harry, went to [[Diagon Alley]] to purchase school supplies for the upcoming year. While there, they visited [[Flourish and Blotts]], where [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] was having a book signing event, during which Arthur got into a [[Muggle duelling|fist fight]] with [[Lucius Malfoy]] over Arthur's support for [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s. He was very excited to meet [[Hermione Granger]]'s [[Hermione Granger's parents|parents]], both Muggle [[dentist]]s, insisting on taking them out for a drink.&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt;

When Harry and Ron were prevented from getting on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9¾]], the pair borrowed the Ford Anglia to fly to Hogwarts. As this was a serious potential breach of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|Statute of Secrecy]], Mr Weasley faced an inquiry at work over the incident.&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt;

====Sirius Black====
{{Quote|Arthur Weasley, Head of the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]] at the Ministry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. A delighted Mr Weasley told the Daily Prophet, “''We will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a curse-breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank''". The Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley children currently attend.|[[MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
In the spring of [[1993]], Arthur and Molly were called to Hogwarts when it was learned the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Monster of Slytherin]] had taken their daughter, Ginny, into the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. It turned out that Lucius Malfoy had planted an old school [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|diary]] of Tom Riddle's on Ginny, which subsequently possessed her and forced her to open the Chamber. Ginny was nearly killed, but was saved by Harry Potter and her brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]].&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt;

[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|250px|thumb|right|The [[Weasley family]] in Egypt]]
Arthur won some money in a ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' drawing and he and his family travelled to [[Egypt]] to visit his son [[William Weasley|Bill]]. In autumn of the same year, when [[Sirius Black]] had escaped from [[Azkaban]] and was believed to be seeking Harry's death, Arthur wanted to tell Harry the truth. He discussed the matter with his wife in secret, not wanting Harry to panic. Harry, however, overheard their conversation. On Platform 9¾, Arthur and Harry briefly discussed what Harry had heard; while pleased that Harry was not scared, Arthur urged Harry not to go seeking Black.&lt;ref name="POA"&gt;{{POA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1994 Quidditch World Cup====
{{Dialogue a-b-c-b|Amos Diggory|She — she might’ve picked [[Harry Potter's wand|it]] up anywhere —|Arthur Weasley|Precisely, Amos. She might have picked it up anywhere.... Winky? Where exactly did you find Harry’s wand?|Winky|I — I is finding it ... finding it there, sir.... there ... in the trees, sir....|You see, Amos? [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Whoever]] conjured the Mark could have Disapparated right after they’d done it, leaving Harry’s wand behind. A clever thing to do, not using their own wand, which could have betrayed them. And Winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up.|Arthur defending [[Winky]] in the aftermath of the Quidditch World Cup riot|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:B4C6M1 boot Portkey to Quidditch World Cup.png|250px|thumb|left|Weasleys, Diggorys, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger in Dartmoor]]
In the summer of [[1994]], Arthur managed to get himself and his family (as well as Harry and Hermione) tickets for the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]] from [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] because Arthur had helped [[Otto Bagman|Otto]], Ludo's brother, out of a minor scrape. Arthur was among the Weasleys who fetched Harry from the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] via the [[Floo Network]]. While there, he expressed his fascination at various Muggle artefacts in the Dursley's house. The group sat in the [[Top Box]], where they were confronted by the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]], who were there by a personal invitation from the Minister himself, though both Arthur and Lucius were able to restrain themselves out of respect for [[Cornelius Fudge|Fudge]].&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

A little while after the Weasleys, along with Harry and Hermione, had returned to their tents, a group of masked [[Death Eaters]] began storming the camp-site, jinxing the camp-site [[Roberts family|manager's family]] and anything or anyone that got in their way. Arthur, along with Percy, Charlie, and Bill, went out to combat them. Before he left, he told Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, Harry, and Hermione to seek refuge in the woods, and that he would find them when it was safe.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

[[File:Barty Crouch Sr. after the QWC campsite riot.jpg|250px|thumb|Reappearance of the Dark Mark over the campsite of the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]]]
Upon seeing the [[Dark Mark]] in the sky, Arthur, along with other Ministry officials, [[Apparition|Apparated]] at once to the location from where the mark had been cast. Upon arrival, he and the other Ministry officials immediately sent out [[Stunning Spell]]s towards the suspected perpetrators, before realising it was Harry, Ron, and Hermione standing in the clearing. He dismissed the possibility that Harry, Ron, or Hermione would have conjured it, even if they had known how to. 

After looking in the bushes in the direction that their Stunners had gone, they found Crouch's house-elf, [[Winky]], unconscious and on the ground next to her was [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s [[Harry Potter's wand|wand]], that he lost sometime during the [[Quidditch]] match. Despite the evidence that Harry's wand had, in fact, been the wand used to summon the Dark Mark, Arthur refused to believe that either Harry or Winky could have been the ones to do it, and that someone else must have been responsible.&lt;ref name="GOF"&gt;{{GOF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the event, Arthur departed the campsite in the morning and returned to the Burrow with the others. Arthur was angered when he was shown a scathing article written by [[Rita Skeeter]] in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', which harshly criticised the failure of Ministry officials to prevent the riot from happening, which even indirectly mentioned himself. Arthur and Percy then returned to the Ministry headquarters straight away to help straighten the mayhem befalling the Ministry.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

===Second Wizarding War {{c|1995-1998}}===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Fred Weasley|Percy and Dad had a row. I've never seen Dad row with anyone like that.|Ron Weasley|Percy came home and told us he'd been promoted... He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.|Only Dad wasn’t.|Recantation of Percy's and Arthur's nasty row|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Order of the Pheonix.png|250px|thumb|left|An Order meeting taking place at 12 Grimmauld Place]]
In [[1995]], Arthur learned about the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and joined the second [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He did this in preparation for the upcoming war. A week into the summer holiday Arthur got into an intense argument with his son Percy. Percy had recently been promoted to [[Junior Assistant to the Minister for Magic|Junior Assistant to the Minister]], working directly for Cornelius Fudge. Percy had hoped his family would be pleased, but Arthur suspected it was a move by the Ministry to put a spy in the staunchly Dumbledore-loyalist Weasley family.

[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-arthur molly.jpg|250px|thumb|Arthur and Molly welcoming Harry]]
Percy proceeded to insult his father, claiming that ever since he started at the Ministry he had to struggle against Arthur's reputation. He stated that Arthur had no ambition, as why Arthur was still working in the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]] because he had no desire for advancement. This was in Percy's eyes, the reason behind the family's poor economic status. Percy continued by saying that Arthur was an idiot to align himself with [[Albus Dumbledore]] and Harry Potter, as he did not believe their statements that Lord Voldemort had returned.  

Percy's own loyalty lay with the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Percy soon moved out and found a flat in central London and did not speak to his family for a long time. Arthur took the betrayal of his son very hard, to the extent that he would break whatever he happened to be holding whenever Percy's name was mentioned.&lt;ref name="OTP" /&gt;

[[File:Arthur and Harry in the Ministry OOTPF.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Arthur escorting Harry to his disciplinary hearing]]
When Harry broke the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|International Statute of Secrecy]] by defending himself and his cousin [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] against two [[Dementor]]s on [[2 August]], Arthur escorted him to his [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter|disciplinary hearing]] before the [[Wizengamot]] on the [[12 August|12th]]. While he normally [[Apparition|Apparated]] to work, Arthur felt arriving in a non-magical fashion would make a better impression, given for what Harry was being disciplined ([[underage magic]]). He was not allowed in with Harry while the trial was in session and waited for him outside the courtroom.&lt;ref name="OTP" /&gt; 

====St Mungo's Hospital====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Arthur Weasley|Well, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for Christmas? Oh, Harry — this is absolutely wonderful —|Molly Weasley|Arthur, you’ve had your bandages changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn’t need doing until tomorrow.|What? No, no — it’s nothing — it’s — I — Well — now don’t get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea.... He’s the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in ... um ... complementary medicine.... I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies ... well, they’re called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on — on Muggle wounds —|Arthur speaking with his wife Molly whilst hospitalised at St Mungos|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Nagini attacks Arthur Weasley.gif|250px|thumb|right|Arthur being attacked by Nagini in the [[Hall of Prophecy]]]]
One night, while guarding the [[Hall of Prophecy]] for the [[Order of the Phoenix]], Arthur was attacked by Voldemort's snake [[Nagini]]; the [[Attack on Arthur Weasley|attack]] was witnessed by Harry, through his mental connection with the Dark Lord. Critically injured, Arthur was taken to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]]. Because of Harry witnessing the event and alerting Dumbledore to it Arthur survived the attack and hence he was transported to St Mungo's in time.&lt;ref name="OTP" /&gt; 

[[File:Weasley christmas.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Arthur during Christmas]]
Arthur was required to take a [[Blood-Replenishing Potion]] every hour. At the suggestion of trainee Healer [[Augustus Pye]], he tried stitches, a Muggle alternative, which Molly did not like. However, the stitches were not effective; Nagini's fangs apparently had a poison that dissolved them prematurely. Eventually, an antidote to the poison was found and he was cured, coming home to find fellow Order members [[Severus Snape]] and [[Sirius Black]] in the middle of a heated argument. Despite this near death experience, Percy did not so much as question about his father's well-being.&lt;ref name="OTP" /&gt;

====Promotion====
{{Quote|I don't know whether Ron's told you in any of his letters ? It's only just happened? But Arthur's been promoted!|Molly Weasley regarding recent promotion|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
After the Ministry finally accepted the truth that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had indeed returned to power, Arthur was promoted to the Head of the [[Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects]]. He had no less than ten people working under him. However, this promotion by [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] might have been an unsuccessful way of trying to warm Harry up to the Ministry, given the time frame of events that took place.&lt;ref name="HBP"&gt;{{HBP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tonks Molly Arthur Lupin.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Arthur at the Burrow along with Molly, Tonks, and Lupin]]
Scrimgeour was put down by Dumbledore on the idea of Dumbledore approaching Harry on Scrimgeour's behalf to get Harry to become a "''mascot''" for the [[Ministry of Magic]]. Having been told by Dumbledore that Harry would not want anything to do with the Ministry following the events of the previous year at Hogwarts, Scrimgeour, who knew that Harry was close to the Weasley family, might have then decided to promote Arthur so that Harry would possibly be more open to joining the Ministry (Molly did say that Arthur's promotion had been within days of Harry's arrival at the Burrow). During the summer, [[the Burrow]] also became the home of his son Bill's new fiancée, [[Fleur Delacour]], much to wife Molly's dismay.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

The Burrow was later placed under the highest security the Ministry could provide, due to arrangements to have Harry Potter stay there for the summer holiday. During this time Arthur would sometimes bring home news of odd accidents or disappearances. One of these disappearances was that of [[Garrick Ollivander]], he brought home the news before it even reached the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-movie-screencaps.com-9053.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry confiding in Arthur his suspicions regarding [[Draco Malfoy]]]]
Arthur later accompanied several of his family members, as well as Harry and Hermione, to [[Diagon Alley]], under the Ministry protection of [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. Harry later spoke to Arthur about suspecting [[Draco Malfoy]] of joining the [[Death Eaters]] and having purchased a Dark artefact from [[Borgin and Burkes]] to presumably use at Hogwarts, before leaving himself for Hogwarts. Later, Arthur once more personally searched [[Malfoy Manor]] for any possible Dark objects, to no avail.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

That year, he sent a letter to his son, Ron to inform the latter that Harry's suspicions were correct.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

====Christmas at the Burrow====
{{Quote|But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else's heads. Mr Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stony-faced. |Percy visiting his family during Christmas holidays|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-christmas at the Burrow.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Arthur spending Christmas with his family, [[Harry Potter]], and Remus Lupin]]
Harry, Ron, and Ginny spent Christmas at [[the Burrow]], where Harry tried to persuade Arthur and [[Remus Lupin]] that there was indeed something Dark about Draco Malfoy. His argument went unheard, as neither believed his theory regarding him. Arthur also tried to keep the peace between Molly and Fleur during the Christmas holidays, the latter of whom had made a negative comment about a song Molly was particularity fond of.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; 

Newly appointed [[Minister for Magic]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] also arrived at the Burrow, with Arthur's son Percy in tow. Molly was overjoyed to see Percy, while Arthur and the twins remained stone-faced. When the Minister announced his intention to speak to Harry alone Arthur prepared to speak, but Harry dismissed him stating that it was fine. Scrimgeour attempted to recruit Harry, with little success, while Percy once again fell out with his family.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

====Battle of the Astronomy Tower====
Harry's suspicions about Draco Malfoy were later proved to be true. He helped [[Death Eaters]] to infiltrate Hogwarts and Dumbledore was killed by [[Severus Snape]]. Arthur and Molly later arrived at Hogwarts shortly after the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] to see their son Bill, who was gravely injured by [[Fenrir Greyback]] during the conflict. The Weasley family sadly attended the funeral of Dumbledore, a man they respected greatly and who had led them as the head of the [[Order of the Phoenix]].&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

====Battle of the Seven Potters====
{{Main|Battle of the Seven Potters}}
{{Quote|I'll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I've seen my son, now back off if you know what's good for you!|Arthur demanding to see George after finding out that he is hurt|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Alastor Moody with Polyjuice Potion DHF1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Arthur and Mad-Eye Moody at 4th Privet Drive]]
During the summer holidays, Arthur participated in the plan to evacuate [[Harry Potter|Harry]] from the home of his aunt and uncle, before his seventeenth birthday. This was done due to Harry needing more protection from Voldemort and his [[Death Eaters]], along with the protection of having a "place to call home" being broken on his seventeenth birthday. The original plan of evacuation was to have Alastor [[Alastor Moody|Moody]] side-along Apparate Harry to the Burrow, but that plan was moot as [[Pius Thicknesse]], the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement|Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] was under the influence of the [[Imperius Curse]] and had sealed off the house. Arthur flew with his son [[Fred Weasley|Fred]].&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-arthur after battle.jpg|250px|thumb|Arthur finding out about George's loss of an ear after the battle]]
Unfortunately, dozens of Death Eaters ambushed the Order members and the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] ensued. [[Alastor Moody]] was murdered by Voldemort himself in the conflict, while Arthur's son [[George Weasley|George]] lost an ear at the hands of Severus Snape, and Harry's owl [[Hedwig]] was killed by an [[Hedwig's killer|unknown Death Eater]]. Harry, however, was successfully transported to [[the Burrow]], which was protected by powerful enchantments. Arthur was confronted on arrival by [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] out of paranoia of him being an impostor or otherwise bewitched; his fatherly concern for George caused the normally laid-back and calm Arthur to not only yell at, but threaten his friend and ally with bodily harm if he did not back off and let him see his injured son.

====Bill and Fleur's wedding====
[[File:Delacour weasley.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Arthur greeting [[Delacour family|Fleur's family]] the wedding in 1997]]
During the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding of Bill and Fleur]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]'s [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] arrived informing the guests that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] had fallen to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] and his Death Eaters. The current Minister for Magic, [[Rufus Scrimgeour]], was brutally tortured and murdered. Death Eaters then interrupted the reception and the Weasley family was placed under constant watch. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, escaped to [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. 

After they arrived, Arthur's [[weasel]] [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] appeared and informed them that the rest of the family was safe, but warned them not to attempt contact as that might cause problems.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

====Ministry under Voldemort's control====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Arthur|One moment, Runcorn. I hear you laid information against [[Dirk Cresswell]]...

And if he survives [[Azkaban]], you'll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons, and his friends...|Arthur confronts whom he believes to be  Albert Runcorn|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
However, Harry saw Arthur again while disguised as [[Albert Runcorn]] by use of [[Polyjuice Potion]] when he, Hermione, and Ron infiltrated the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. He found out that Arthur was under surveillance by the Voldemort-controlled Ministry for his "[[blood traitor]]" status. Arthur was one of the few people who made his disgust for the Ministry's anti-[[Non-magic people|Muggle]] and [[Muggle-born]] stance very clear. He confronted Albert Runcorn (actually Harry Potter in disguise) who seems to have been considered very intimidating by most Ministry employees, about turning Muggle-born wizard Dirk Cresswell into the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]].&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{DH}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-movie-screencaps.com-6620.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Arthur's Ministry file, kept in [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s desk]]
Arthur also had a file at the Ministry regarding his blood-status, his family's status, and his status in the Ministry. The file was kept in Dolores Umbridge's office. Harry tried to warn Arthur that his movements were being monitored by the Ministry, but Arthur thought he was trying to threaten him.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

When Harry accidentally broke the [[taboo]] on Voldemort's name in [[1998]], the Death Eaters realised that Ron was with Harry, and the other Weasleys, including Arthur, were forced into hiding and prevented from going to work. They stayed with Molly's Aunt [[Muriel]] during this time.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
{{Quote|As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there.

[[File:Arthur weasley duel.gif|250px|thumb|left|Arthur duelling a [[Unidentified Death Eater who engaged Arthur Weasley|Death Eater]] during the Battle of Hogwarts]]
In [[May]], Arthur arrived at the school to take part in the Battle of Hogwarts. His estranged son [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] arrived just in time to apologise to his family. Percy also expressed his wish to take part in the fight against [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s encroaching army. Arthur and Percy reconciled, and all the Weasleys took part in the battle. 

[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|Arthur and the other defenders of Hogwarts witnessing Harry Potter's final defeat of Voldemort]]
During the second half of the battle, he and Percy duelled and defeated [[Pius Thicknesse]] and also witnessed his wife kill [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] after she nearly killed Ginny. He also witnesses Harry's final defeat of Voldemort. During the battle, Arthur lost his son, Fred, which devastated him, his wife and the rest of their children, as well as Harry and Hermione.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; After the Battle, he was seen sitting with several members of his family.

===Later life {{c|Post 1998}}===
[[File:Brilliant Arthur Weasley WU.png|228x228px|thumb|left|A younger Arthur]]
Having moved back to the Burrow following the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] with his wife, in the years that followed, their family grew even larger, with most of his children marrying and having children of their own.&lt;ref name="DH2"&gt;{{DH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having presumably embraced the challenge of de-corrupting the Ministry under [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]'s new leadership, Arthur returned to his old job as Head of the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]],&lt;ref name="DP"&gt;{{DP}} ([[Classified Advertisements]]: "For Sale: Muggle 'batteries' – collection has grown too large to house, any reasonable offer accepted. Contact A. Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, Ministry of Magic.")&lt;/ref&gt; having previously missed working with Muggle artefacts during his stint at the [[Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects|larger division]].&lt;ref name="HBP5"&gt;{{HBP|B|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after this, he rose to a higher office within the Ministry, having been promoted to the position of [[Head of Department|Head]] of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]].&lt;ref name="WU SU"&gt;{{WU}} ([[Brilliant Event: Stronger United]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Their home also became "''quite the photo op for wizarding history buffs''" following the publishing of a book titled ''[[One Hundred Historical Sites from the Second Wizarding War]]'',&lt;ref name="WU TBB"&gt;{{WU}} (Brilliant Event: The Burrow Besieged)&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon its role as the headquarters of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] became public knowledge. Ron suggested that they should charge a fee for the number of tourists that subsequently showed up to photograph and be photographed with their old front sign, an idea that Arthur firmly refused to go along with.&lt;ref name="WU AWP"&gt;{{WU}} ([[Brilliant Event: A Weasley Predicament]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Calamity {{c|2010s}}===
[[File:WU Brilliant Arthur Weasley.png|221x221px|thumb|Arthur, a retired septuagenarian]]
By [[2020]], Arthur Weasley had stepped down from his post as [[Head of Department]], in which he had been succeeded by his son-in-law, [[Harry Potter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted to have been particularly proud of the accomplishment that was [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], in his old age, Arthur was often found perusing their products while visiting [[Diagon Alley]].&lt;ref name="WU AWP" /&gt; 

Following the outbreak of the [[Calamity]], Arthur, while retired, still assisted the newly created [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] in returning [[Foundable]]s that had been displaced in the [[Non-magic world|Muggle world]].&lt;ref name="WU TBB" /&gt; Around the same time, a younger version of himself appeared as a [[Foundable]], forcing volunteer [[Calamity Investigator|members]] of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force|SOS Task Force]] to track him down to free him, allowing him to return to his original time.&lt;ref name="WU2"&gt;{{WU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
Like many other members of the [[Weasley family]], Arthur had bright red hair, though he was balding by the early 1990s. He wore glasses and had green eyes, and also possessed the tall, thin build inherited by his sons Ron and [[William Weasley|Bill]].&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt; 

He also had visible marks somewhere on his body from a decent caning whilst at Hogwarts, for being late. The punishment was set by the caretaker at the time, [[Apollyon Pringle]].&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|That's what's held Arthur back at the Ministry, honest as the day is long, reliable, trustworthy and able... all qualities guaranteed to stop you moving forward at the Ministry these days.|An attendee of the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour]] regarding Arthur's positive qualities|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game)}}
[[File:B2C4M3 Flourish and Blotts.png|250px|thumb|left|Arthur fighting with Lucius Malfoy in [[Flourish and Blotts]]]]
In the [[wizarding world]], Arthur Weasley was known for being a well-meaning, reasonable and competent every-man, trying to take care of his family and do the right thing. A man of principle, he was strongly opposed to the discrimination of [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s, [[Muggle-born]]s, [[half-blood]]s, [[half-breed]]s, and cursed beings such as [[werewolf|werewolves]], and did not think highly of those who subscribed to such intolerant beliefs, despite it being the prevailing views of so many of his fellow [[pure-blood]]s. While this earned him respect of his friends and family, others, such as [[Lucius Malfoy]], considered him to be a "[[blood traitor]]."&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt; and a "''disgrace to the name of wizard''". The latter, however, he never truly took to heart, as his opinion about what disgraced the name of wizard differed greatly from theirs. 

{{Dialogue a-b|Molly Weasley|Your sons flew that car to Harry's house and back last night! What have you got to say about that, eh?|Arthur Weasley|Did you really? Did it go all right? I — I mean, that — that was very wrong, boys — very wrong indeed....|Arthur showing a supportive attitude towards his children's mischeif-making|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
While Arthur Weasley was often seen as "''fun''" in the earlier years, with the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the gathering crisis in the wizarding world he shouldered a role of increasing challenges, assuming duties within the [[Order of the Phoenix]] in addition to new responsibilities at the Ministry. He was protective of Harry, and at times assumed a father like role, a position previously occupied by Harry's godfather [[Sirius Black]], and by [[Albus Dumbledore]]. He was a man of principle and remained loyal to Dumbledore, even though this impeded his advancement in the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and cost him the respect of Percy, who also worked at the Ministry but agreed more strongly with the policies of the [[Minister for Magic]]. 

A devoted father, Arthur was the more laid-back parent than his wife, but was nevertheless very protective of them, and loved his own flesh and blood so much that the only times he was seen to lose control of himself was when any of his children were hurt. In addition, he could also get just as angry at them as his wife if they did something very seriously bad; an example of this was when he went berserk on catching Fred and George trying to trick Ron into making an Unbreakable Vow, a potentially lethal act of magic, and his reaction was so pronouncedly different from his usual temperament that Ron still recalled it over a decade later and Fred swore at least one part of his anatomy was never the same since.

{{Quote|But you're Muggles! We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly, look!|Arthur Weasley's fascination with Muggles|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Harry-potter2-mr &amp; mrs granger.jpg|250px|thumb|Arthur with Mr and Mrs Granger in [[Flourish and Blotts]]|alt=]]

Arthur was fascinated at how Muggles were able to go about their lives without magic. Whenever he found himself in close proximity to them, he had a hard time containing his enthusiasm. During Harry's stays at the Burrow, he liked to sit next to Harry, in order to ask him questions about living with them and had at various times attempted to engage the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] in conversation about [[electricity]]. In 1992, when he learned Harry had never travelled by the Floo Network, he joyfully began to ask about the "''[[Escalator|escapators]]''" in the [[London Underground]]. When the Weasleys and Harry met [[Hermione Granger]] in [[Diagon Alley]] that same year, Arthur was ecstatic to meet Hermione's parents, both Muggles, who were exchanging money at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]]. While the other family members went shopping for school supplies, Arthur insisted on taking [[Hermione Granger's father|Mr]] and [[Hermione Granger's mother|Mrs Granger]] for a drink in the Leaky Cauldron.&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt; 

{{Quote|They run off [[Electricity|eckeltricity]], do they? Ah yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs. And batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I'm [[Insanity|mad]], but there you are.|Arthur to Muggle [[Vernon Dursley]] regarding Muggle appliances|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
In addition to his Ford Anglia, Arthur also collected a number of other Muggle items. He had a large collection of [[plug]]s and [[Battery|batteries]], as well as other undisclosed items in his shed. After successfully transporting Harry to [[the Burrow]] in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], Arthur showed Harry the remains of Sirius' motorcycle and told him he was eager to learn how the brakes worked and that he also wanted to put it back together when [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] was not around. In time, Arthur did put it back together and returned it to Harry.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; When given the chance to use matches to light a bonfire, Arthur enjoyed it immensely, even though he was not successful.

[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-movie-screencaps.com-9040.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]] surrounded by Arthur's collection of Muggle objects|alt=]]

Because of his fondness for Muggles, in 1992, he drafted a proposition for the Ministry called the [[Muggle Protection Act]]. Many pure-blood wizards took offence to this, and [[Lucius Malfoy]] attempted to sabotage Arthur's plans; by planting Riddle's diary on Arthur's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and bury the legislation.&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt; So adamant in protecting Muggles, he was outraged at Fred and George's prank on Dudley Dursley, even though the twins did not target Dudley because he was a Muggle, but rather he was a horrible boy. 

When he took his family, Harry and Hermione to the [[Quidditch World Cup]] in 1994, he was adamant about remaining incognito. He insisted on putting up their tents by hand and cooking their food outside with a fire. While somewhat familiar with the concept, he had trouble with a Muggle matchbox; he would light a match and subsequently drop it in surprise. In the end, he managed to get the fire lit with Hermione's help and seemed to have a great time. When [[Death Eaters]] started a riot after the cup, Arthur was one of the people who acted to protect Muggle victims.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

His wall in the [[Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]] was covered with Muggle pictures, including several of Muggle cars (one of which was a disassembled motor) Muggle post boxes, which he appeared to have cut out of a Muggle children's book and a diagram of how to wire a plug. His greatest ambition was to find out how Muggles were able to keep aeroplanes airborne. Arthur's love of engineering and Muggle technology was inherited by his sons Fred and George in that they too possessed Arthur's ingenuity and almost compulsive need to invent or modify things from their intended purposes, resulting in many of the twins' joke items.

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Dialogue a-b|Molly Weasley|Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly.|Arthur Weasley|Well, dear, I think you’ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if — er — he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth.... There’s a loophole in the law, you’ll find.... As long as he wasn’t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn’t —|Arthur defending his creation of a [[Flying Ford Anglia|flying car]] to his wife|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

*'''[[Charm]]s''': Arthur was shown to be particularly gifted with charm-work, having placed various charms, spells, and enchantments on Muggle objects. For example, he once charmed a [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia car]] to be able to [[Levitation|fly]] and become [[Invisibility|invisible]]. With help from Hagrid, Arthur also enchanted Sirius' flying motorcycle, enabling it to produce [[fire]] like that of a [[dragon]]'s as a weapon, and a brick wall as a defence from the tail-pipe. Arthur was also able to conjure a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] in the form of a [[Weasel]], which is an extremely advanced and powerful piece of magic as well as proof of superior [[magic]]al ability. As a member of the Order of the Phoenix, he was able to send messages using his Patronus.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Arthur was also highly proficient with the [[Memory Charm]], having used it to erase the memories of [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] who had unwittingly witnessed magic, as part of his career duties with the Ministry.&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Arthur was capable of casting [[spell]]s without speaking their [[incantation]]s aloud, having been able to effectively perform a non-verbal ''[[Oculus Reparo]]'' on [[Harry Potter]]'s broken [[Glasses]] in [[1992]],&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt; which testifies to him being a powerful wizard as non-verbal magic was very difficult.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Arthur was shown to be skilled in this department of magic to a high level, given how he was able to effectively perform [[conjuration]], which is a highly advanced and difficult branch of transfiguration. He [[Candle-conjuring spell|conjured candles]] to light up the Burrow garden one summer evening, and [[Chair-conjuring spell|conjured several chairs]] for his family when they came to visit him at St Mungo's, both with seemingly little effort.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Arthur was shown to be a very proficient duellist. He was fully confident that he could match his rival [[Lucius Malfoy]] (a notably skilled duellist himself) in skill if not defeat him. When the [[Death Eaters]] [[Reappearance of the Dark Mark|attacked]] the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], he helped the Ministry chase off the Death Eaters and did not suffer any injuries from the incident. He was chosen as one of the protectors during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] where he survived unscathed, most likely defeating several Death Eaters in the process or at least holding them at bay. Later during [[Battle of Hogwarts]], he was chosen to lead one of the teams of combatants onto the grounds, and at one point engages in a fierce duel with [[Unidentified Death Eater who engaged Arthur Weasley|a Death Eater]] where he likely emerged victorious. Later on, along with his son, [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], he took down the [[Imperius Curse|Imperiused]] [[Pius Thicknesse]] in the latter half of the battle, and emerged as one of the survivors of the Second Wizarding War.
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most adult wizards, Arthur was capable of Apparating successfully at will. He usually Apparated to work at the [[British Ministry of Magic Headquarters]].&lt;ref name="OOTP7"&gt;{{OOTP|B|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mechanical skills''': Due to Arthur's interest in Muggle technology, particularly automobiles, Arthur developed quite a bit of skill in repairing muggle machinery in his spare time. Along with his flying car, Arthur made several mechanical and magical modifications to Sirius Black's motorcycle. Though the bike was severely damaged during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], he managed to repair the vehicle to perfect working order, which he then later returned to Harry, who as Sirius's named heir, was the bike's proper owner. He likely improved his skills significantly during this little sojourn into automotive engineering and learned a great deal from it.
*'''[[Muggle Studies|Muggle Knowledge]]''': As stated above, unlike the most part of wizard community, Arthur Weasley was fascinated by Muggles and the Muggle world; he spent his whole life studying Muggles' way of life and acquired an acceptable, although almost purely theoretical, knowledge of their world, even if he still had some gaps (for instance, he had troubles with the Muggle monetary system, particularly with banknotes).  However, he learned how to drive a car.
*'''[[Magical Law|Legal skills]]''': Working at the Ministry of Magic, Arthur developed a good knowledge of [[Magical Law]]. Specifically referring to his area of specialisation, Muggles, he notably helped to draft a [[Muggle Protection Act]] and wrote the [[law regarding ownership of charmed objects]].&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt; and when [[Ali Bashir]] wanted to import flying carpets into the country, Arthur sent him an owl to inform him that the Ministry had outlawed flying carpets in Great Britain, as they were defined as a Muggle Artefact by the [[Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects]].&lt;ref name="GOF"/&gt; As he was later promoted to [[Head of Department]], he likely had a considerable, well-rounded understanding of Wizarding law overall.&lt;ref name="WU2" /&gt;
[[File:Arthur Weasley wand.png|215x215px|thumb|Arthur's wand]]

==Possessions==
*'''[[Arthur Weasley's wand|Wand]]''': Arthur was chosen by a [[wand]] of unknown materials.
*'''[[Arthur Weasley's shed|Shed]]''': He owned a shed which he kept on the grounds of the Burrow.
*'''[[Arthur Weasley's non-magical junk|Muggle artefacts]]''': In the family shed, he kept an impressive collection of Muggle artefacts. He also collected plugs.
*'''[[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]] (formerly)''': Among his Muggle Artefacts was a Ford Anglia, which he enchanted to make it fly. When his son Ron and Harry Potter flew it to Hogwarts Castle in 1992, it escaped into the Forbidden Forest on its own.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====Parents and siblings====
Arthur was the son of [[Septimus Weasley|Septimus]] and [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella Weasley]]. They were both [[pure-blood]]s, although Cedrella was disowned by her family, because she married a blood-traitor. The relationship between them is unknown; it is possible that his father's point of view made Arthur realise that there was no difference between [[Wizardkind|wizards]] and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s. Arthur also had at least [[Arthur Weasley's brothers|two brothers]].

====Wife, children and grandchildren====
[[File:Weasley family.png|250x250px|thumb|left|The Weasley family]]

Arthur eventually married [[Molly Weasley|Molly Prewett]], whom he had been dating since [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and they had seven children; [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], the twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. Arthur was less strict than his wife, and his children thought he was funny. He had a good relationship with all of them, before his son Percy became angry with him. However, during the [[Second Wizarding War]], Arthur appeared to have been more protective, because he was afraid of what happened to his children.

His son Bill was a very good student; he had become [[prefect]] and [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] during his years at Hogwarts. He later worked for [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] in [[Egypt]] and married [[Fleur Delacour]].

Charlie was also a good student; he was [[prefect]] and [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. He studied [[dragon]]s in [[Romania]], but he never married.

He also had a good relationship with Percy, but their relationship was broken up in 1995. Percy was more serious than his father, and they both worked for the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], although Percy loved to obey the rules and was also very ambitious. Arthur forgave his son in 1998, during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] when Percy was ready to apologise for his previous actions.

His sense of humour was similar to Fred and George's. He loved them very much, and, although they were not model students, Arthur knew they were very clever wizards. Though not as strict towards their mischievous behaviour, a few rare exceptions are when they attempted an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with Ron in their earlier years, in 1994 when they left a [[Ton-Tongue Toffee]] for [[Dudley Dursley]] to have, and in 1995, when he agreed with his wife on their irresponsible use of magic ever since they had [[Trace|come of age]]. Fred was killed during the Battle of Hogwarts; Arthur was grief-stricken over his death.

[[File:Tumblr lyigdsno6O1qam4lbo3 250.gif|245x245px|thumb|Arthur with his youngest son Ron in [[1997]]]]

Arthur was very protective of Ron and Ginny, who were his youngest children. Ginny was the youngest and the only daughter. When she was possessed by a memory of [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]], in a diary, Arthur was very upset; he shouted at Ginny, saying that he had told her not to trust magical objects that had a mind of their own. He also helped Ron to his mission; he hexed the [[Weasley family ghoul|family ghoul]], along with Fred and George, in order to make it look like Ron, who had gone to help Harry and Hermione find and destroy Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es.

After the Second Wizarding War, Arthur's family extended even more, through his children; he appeared to have at least twelve grandchildren: [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]] and [[Louis Weasley|Louis]], who were the children of Bill and Fleur; [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]] and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]], Percy and [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey]]'s children; [[Fred Weasley II|Fred]] and [[Roxanne Weasley|Roxanne]] who were the children of George and [[Angelina Johnson]]; [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]], who were Ron and Hermione's children; and [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]], who were Ginny and Harry's children. He had a good relationship with his grandchildren, but, according to Ron (who may or may not have been joking), he would not let them marry any pure-bloods.

====Harry Potter====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Arthur Weasley|Harry, swear to me you won’t go looking for [[Sirius Black|Black]].|Harry Potter|What!|Promise me, Harry,  whatever happens —|Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me?|Swear to me that whatever you might hear —|Arthur's worry about Harry's safety|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}

[[File:Harry Potter.jpg|233x233px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]], his future son-in-law]]

Harry Potter was Ron's best friend. He met Arthur in [[1992]], at [[the Burrow]]. Arthur liked to discuss [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] things with Harry Potter and had entrusted Harry with certain information that many felt him too young to understand, such as in [[1993]] when the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] would not tell Harry that they thought [[Sirius Black]] was going to seek him out. Harry had also saved Arthur's life once when Harry saw him being attacked by [[Nagini]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]] before Christmas of [[1995]]. They fought together at the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and both survived the [[Second Wizarding War]].

As Molly once said that Harry was like a son to her, it is possible that Arthur felt the same way. Arthur became like a father to Harry. Harry married Arthur's daughter Ginny and became Arthur's only son-in-law. He also had three children with Ginny, who are some of Arthur's many grandchildren: James, Albus, and Lily.

====Hermione Granger====
[[File:Hermione Granger.jpg|234x234px|thumb|[[Hermione Granger]], his future daughter-in-law]]

Because of her friendships with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], Hermione Granger became friendly with the entire [[Weasley family]]. She spent a portion of many of her summer and [[Christmas holidays]] at their home of [[the Burrow]] and attended some family outings with them, such as shopping for school supplies in [[Diagon Alley]] and attending the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]] with them. 

Arthur was fascinated by the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] world and thus Hermione's background and even invited Hermione's [[Granger family|parents]] for a drink upon first meeting them in Diagon alley before the start of her second year. He seemed to like Hermione, as if she were his daughter. Hermione married Ron, and became one of Arthur's many daughters-in-law. She also had two children with Ron, who were Arthur's grandchildren; Rose and Hugo.

===Albus Dumbledore===

[[File:Albus Dumbledore POA promo.jpg|238x238px|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his friend and former headmaster]]

Arthur considered Albus Dumbledore as being the greatest wizard of all time. Dumbledore was the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] headmaster at the time Arthur attended Hogwarts. They were both sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house and appeared to be on friendly terms. They both believed in the equality of all wizards and Muggles. Dumbledore seemed to like most people, especially the Weasleys, because they were all fair and good people. Arthur also served in the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]] with Dumbledore, who was the leader. When Arthur was bitten by [[Nagini]], Dumbledore was upset; he helped find him, using the portraits that were hung at the office of Dumbledore. 

In [[1997]], Arthur learned about Albus Dumbledore's [[death]] and that [[Severus Snape]] was the murderer. Arthur was very sad and sat with his family, the professors, and other students, discussing how Snape killed Dumbledore. In fact, Dumbledore, who was about to die as a result of wearing a [[Marvolo Gaunt's Ring|cursed ring]], had asked Snape to kill him, because Dumbledore did not want the other [[Death Eaters]] to guess Snape's true loyalties, did not want [[Draco Malfoy]] to become a murderer, and did not want to die a painful, drawn-out death.

===Cornelius Fudge===

He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister of Magic.|Arthur Weasley explaining Fudge's fear and paranoia to Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Cornelius Fudge.jpg|279x279px|thumb|[[Cornelius Fudge]], former British Minister of Magic]]

As Arthur was a lower-class person and having a poor family, Cornelius Fudge always neglected Arthur while having a manipulated friendship with his wealthy rival, [[Lucius Malfoy]], due to Fudge's swaying of money and power. Fudge also happened to consider Arthur strange because of his obsession with [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s, causing Fudge to think he lacked proper wizarding pride, thus he held Arthur back within the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. 

When [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned, Fudge suspected Arthur being in league with Dumbledore since he was aware that the two of them were friendly. He even invited Arthur's son, [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] to become his Junior Assistant in an attempt to spy on the Weasley family and Dumbledore, which led to Percy defecting from his family after a row with Arthur. Fudge ignored Arthur and Harry's existences when he and the [[Wizengamot]] exited [[Courtroom Ten]]. After Fudge was disgraced and forced to resign, Arthur was instantly promoted by Fudge's successor.

===Lucius Malfoy===

[[File:Lucius Malfoy Profile.jpg|258x258px|thumb|left|[[Lucius Malfoy]], his rival and enemy]]

Arthur and Lucius Malfoy despised each other (as Arthur himself noted, the two of them had very different personalities), often exchanging insults when they met and even getting into a fistfight on at least one occasion. Lucius disdained the [[Weasley family]] for their poverty and so-called [[blood traitor]] status; while the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] prized their [[pure-blood]] heritage, the Weasleys accepted [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s and [[Muggle-born]]s. He and Arthur apparently clashed multiple times over this at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], where Arthur worked and Lucius visited regularly to see Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge.

When Arthur proposed the [[Muggle Protection Act]] in [[1992]], Lucius was furious to the point of trying to sabotage Arthur by placing an [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|old diary]] of [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]]’s on Arthur’s eleven-year-old daughter, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], endangering her life as well as those of Muggle-born [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] students, as this led to the opening of the [[Chamber of Secrets]].&lt;ref name="COS" /&gt; Also, Arthur never believed Lucius' claim that he had been under the [[Imperius Curse]] during the [[First Wizarding War]], indicating that their enmity likely dates back to their younger years. 

===Order of the Phoenix===
{{Quote|We’ve managed to convince a couple of people, though. Tonks here, for one — she’s too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage — Kingsley Shacklebolt’s been a real asset too. He’s in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he’s been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in [[Tibet]].|Arthur informing Harry Potter about the work of the Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|251x251px|thumb|[[Order of the Phoenix]], his allies]]

Arthur had a good relationship with most members of the Order of the Phoenix. Arthur was not an official member of the first order, but he became a member of the second order during the [[Second Wizarding War]].

He seemed to know [[Sirius Black]] since the [[First Wizarding War]]. After the war, Sirius was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for betraying the Potters to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] and killing [[Peter Pettigrew's unidentified victims|twelve Muggles]]. In fact, [[Peter Pettigrew]] had committed the crimes and blamed Sirius. Arthur believed that when Sirius escaped from the prison, he wanted to kill [[Harry Potter]]. He told Harry not to try to find Sirius, as he knew that Harry would learn about Sirius's crimes. Harry, Ron, and Hermione learned the truth in [[1994]], and Pettigrew escaped again. 

Arthur and Sirius became friendly in the second Order. They lived in the same house for a short time; Sirius also tried to comfort Arthur's children when Arthur was bitten by [[Nagini]]. Sirius was killed by his cousin [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. Arthur's first reaction is unknown; he only tried not to talk about Sirius in front of Harry, knowing how that would make the boy feel. Arthur and Sirius were also distant relatives, through Arthur's mother.

Arthur appeared to be on good terms with [[Remus Lupin]], too. Remus was a [[werewolf]], but Arthur did not care about that; he thought Lupin was a good person. Furthermore, they had the same beliefs about blood purity, and they were both poor. Lupin was the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor at Hogwarts for a short time when Ron, Ginny, Fred, George and Percy were attending the school. They all thought Remus was a good teacher. Arthur and Remus became members of the Order during the [[Second Wizarding War]]; they fought together at the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]; during the final battle, Remus was killed. His body lay near Fred's, and the Weasley family looked very sad by both deaths.

Arthur seemed to like his daughter-in-law, [[Fleur Delacour]]. Unlike his wife and daughter, Arthur did not dislike her; after the war, Arthur had three grandchildren through Fleur.

[[Rubeus Hagrid]] was a member of the Order and very loyal to Dumbledore. He seemed to know the Weasleys since their earlier years, as they appeared to be friends in [[1992]]. Hagrid told Arthur not to argue with [[Lucius Malfoy]], believing that he was not worth it. Hagrid was also the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor of Ron and Ginny. The whole Weasley family appeared to be friendly with Hagrid. They were members of the Order who fought together at the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. They both survived the war.

Arthur had a high opinion of [[Alastor Moody]], whom he had met at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. He thought Moody was a little mad but a very powerful and brave Auror, who had captured dozens of [[Death Eaters]]. They were friends, as well as members of the second Order. Arthur's children thought Moody was mad, too. Moody led the group of order members that fought at the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. Moody was killed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the battle. Arthur was sad about his death.

Arthur also seemed to be on good terms with [[Severus Snape]], despite the fact that Snape disliked his children. However, when he learned that Snape killed Dumbledore, he and his family obviously turned against him but that was most likely retracted when he learned of Snape's true loyalties from Harry. In addition, one of Arthur's grandchildren, [[Albus Potter]], was named after Snape. 

Arthur was also friendly with [[Nymphadora Tonks]]. Tonks was a young woman, as well as an Auror. Arthur and Tonks also knew each other through the Ministry of Magic. During the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], Tonks was responsible for Ron, they were paired together. Tonks managed to save herself and Ron from [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], and then Arthur thanked Tonks. She was eventually murdered by Bellatrix during the Battle of Hogwarts. Her dead body was put near Fred and Lupin's, and the Weasleys looked very sad by the deaths of all of them. It is unknown if he had met her son [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]], but considering how Teddy was the godson of Arthur's son-in-law Harry, coupled with the fact that by 2017 Teddy was dating Arthur's granddaughter Victoire, it is possible that Teddy and Arthur were on good terms.

He appeared to be a friend of [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], as well. They were only members of the second Order. They fought together in many battles and survived the [[Second Wizarding War]].

Many members of the Order were killed during battles in both wars; it is likely Arthur got on well with them.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:AWeasley4840.jpg|150px|thumb|Arthur Weasley as a LEGO mini-figure]]
[[File:Arthur Weasley LEGO HP1-4.png|150px|thumb|Arthur Weasley in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
[[File:ArthurWeasleyWU.png|150px|thumb|Arthur Weasley as seen in {{WU}}]]
*Arthur is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[Mark Williams]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]''.
*Arthur was originally intended to die in either the fifth or seventh book (particularly when [[Nagini]] attacked him), but J. K. Rowling decided against it, because he was "one of the few good fathers in the series" and because she didn't want to turn Ron into "half a Harry" i.e. losing one of his parents. Doing so would remove Ron's light hearted comic relief, as most of his humour stems from his immaturity and insensitivity. [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]], two other good parents, were killed off to compensate for this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more&lt;/ref&gt;
*There may be a pattern in the [[Weasley family]] of naming after characters from Arthurian Legend. King Arthur was a legendary British ruler; the names "Percy" and "Ginny" may also be derived from the legendary figures of Percival and Guinevere, respectively. Ron could have originated from the name of King Arthur's spear.
*In {{COS|FA}}, he comments to Mr and Mrs Granger "I understand other Muggles are quite afraid of you." This refers to a common Muggle phobia of visiting the [[dentist]], as Mr and Mrs Granger are both dentists.
*In the films, Arthur is shown without glasses, and he is not balding, as he is described in the books. In fact, Arthur's hair appears to lengthen as the film series progresses.
*He also wears bow-ties in the films, something which was not acknowledged in the novels.
*In {{POA|FA}}, when Arthur is telling Harry about [[Sirius Black]], Harry uses the name "Voldemort" and Arthur tells him not to say the name; but in {{HBP|FA}}, when Arthur is talking to Harry about Draco Malfoy, Arthur ''actually says'' the name "Voldemort".
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Arthur Weasley attended the third task for the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. In the book, Arthur was notably the only one of the older Weasley family members that did not attend any of the tasks, with Charlie managing the dragons in the first task, Percy filling in for [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Crouch Snr]] in the second task, and Molly and Bill attending as part of the audience during the third task. These four were cut from the film.
*In {{DH|GA1}}, it is Arthur who reads [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s [[The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore|will]] and gives the trio what was left for them, rather than [[Rufus Scrimgeour]].
*It is revealed in the sixth book that his greatest ambition is learning how aeroplanes stay up.
*Based on how Arthur developed his skills in automotive engineering and other skills in muggle machinery, it can be assumed that he has a kinesthetic learning style - in that he learns best by doing rather than simply analysing. This is supported by his very hands-on way of going about things, somewhat overly enthusiastic personality, and borderline need to challenge himself.
