'''Professor Neville Longbottom''' (b. [[30 July]] [[1980]])&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ootp37" /&gt; was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[pure-blood]]&lt;ref name="blood" /&gt; [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the only child and son of [[Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Alice Longbottom]]. Neville's parents were well-respected [[Auror]]s and members of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]] until they were tortured into insanity by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and three other [[Death Eaters]] with the [[Cruciatus Curse]] when he was about sixteen months old. They were placed in the [[Janus Thickey Ward]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], leaving Neville to be raised by his grandmother, [[Augusta Longbottom]]. 

At the time of his birth, Neville was marked by [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|a prophecy]] as being one of two children with the potential to defeat [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], the most powerful and feared [[Dark Wizard]] in the world. However, Voldemort's [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|first attempt]] to circumvent the prophecy by killing Neville's later friend and classmate [[Harry Potter]], ultimately established Harry as Voldemort's nemesis.  

Neville began school at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]], along with [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley]]. Throughout his school years, he was mostly a shy, clumsy, introverted boy who was constantly being told by his grandmother that he was not good enough or living up to his parents' accomplishments. However, in his later years, he showed that he possessed great courage and perseverance: he became an important member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation taught and led by [[Harry Potter]] with the goal of helping other students learn spells to attack and defend themselves.   

Neville would later fight in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] ([[1996]]), the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] ([[1997]]), and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] ([[1998]]). During the Battle of Hogwarts, having refused Voldemort's invitation to join the Death Eaters, he destroyed the sixth and final [[Horcrux]] when he beheaded the snake [[Nagini]]. He also co-led the D.A. during his final year in opposition to the Death Eater professors.  

After the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Neville briefly served as an [[Auror]], before becoming the [[Herbology]] [[professor]] and the [[Head of Gryffindor House]]&lt;ref name="MA October"/&gt; at Hogwarts and marrying [[Hannah Abbott]] from [[Hufflepuff]]. He was also the godfather of [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]'s second son, [[Albus Potter]].   

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1980–1991}}===
{{Quote|The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies...and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies.|[[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Longbottom family portrait.png|250x250px|thumb|left|Infant Neville with his mother and father]]
Neville Longbottom was born on [[30 July]], [[1980]], to [[Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Alice Longbottom]], a pair of [[Auror]]s.&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ootp37" /&gt; Moments after his birth, Neville was able to adjust his blankets so that he was swaddled more snugly, but no one witnessed this unusually precocious display of [[underage magic]].&lt;ref name="PM-NevilleBirth"&gt;{{WW|the-quill-of-acceptance-and-the-book-of-admittance}}&lt;/ref&gt; The midwife who attended the birth assumed that his father had tucked him in more tightly.&lt;ref name="PM-NevilleBirth" /&gt; Neville was born "several hours" before his classmate, Harry. 

As a [[pure-blood]] wizard, he was likely related to other wizarding families such as the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], [[Crouch family|Crouches]], [[Potter family|Potters]], and the [[House of Black|Blacks]]. Neville's parents were members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and in these roles, they defied [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] at least three times. Neville was one of two infants referred to in a prophecy made by [[Sybill Trelawney]] about the person with the power to defeat the Dark Lord. The other was [[Harry Potter]], and it was Harry whom Voldemort targeted on [[31 October]], [[1981]] making Harry his equal and leading to his first defeat.&lt;ref name="ootp37" /&gt;

Shortly after, a handful of Voldemort's most loyal followers attacked the Longbottoms. Frank and Alice were tortured into insanity with the [[Cruciatus Curse]] by [[Death Eaters]] [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], her husband [[Rodolphus Lestrange]], her brother-in-law [[Rabastan Lestrange]], and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]]. The four Death Eaters were all sentenced to [[Azkaban]] for their crimes, while Frank and Alice were sent to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's Hospital]], where they would live the rest of their lives, not being able to recognise their own son. Neville was subsequently raised by his paternal grandmother, [[Augusta Longbottom]]. At some point early in his life, he also witnessed the death of his grandfather.&lt;ref name="GOF30"&gt;{{GOF|B|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AugustaAndNeville1991.jpg|210x210px|thumb|Neville with his grandmother at platform 9¾ before boarding the Hogwarts Express]]
Neville's grandmother was a stern and formidable woman who was concerned when her grandson did not exhibit early signs of magic (Neville did, however, show faint signs of magic in him throughout his early years, something which his family persistently missed — the first such sign took place moments after birth, when Neville managed to magically shift his blankets more snugly over himself, something which went unnoticed by midwife who attended his mother&lt;ref name="PM-NevilleBirth" /&gt;). She often chided Neville for not living up to his family's honour and was partly the reason for Neville's lack of self-confidence early in his school years. 

His relatives feared that Neville might be a [[Squib]], though this was disproved when his great-uncle [[Algie Longbottom|Algie]] was holding him out of a window by his feet when he was offered some lemon meringue and let go. Miraculously, Neville bounced. Previous to this, there were various attempts to make him show signs of magic, including dropping him off Blackpool pier, where, according to Neville, he nearly drowned. Neville inherited his father's wand at the age of eleven when he started to attend Hogwarts. This wand was later broken during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].

===Hogwarts years {{C|1991–1998}}===
====First year====
{{Quote|You can't go out, you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble... I won't let you do it. I'll — I'll fight you!|Neville bravely standing up to his [[Trio|friends]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Neville began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on 1 September, 1991. While with his grandmother at [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|platform 9¾]], he lost his toad [[Trevor]]. Once on the train, he met [[Hermione Granger]], who agreed to help him find his lost toad, and then [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] when he entered their compartment tearfully looking for Trevor. After arriving at [[Hogsmeade station]], Neville managed to retrieve his toad from [[Rubeus Hagrid]].&lt;ref name="PS6"&gt;{{PS|B|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neville being Sorted.jpg|246x246px|thumb|left|Neville being sorted in 1991]]
Neville felt intimidated by Gryffindor's reputation for bravery. During the [[Sorting Ceremony]], he silently argued for a long time to be placed in [[Hufflepuff]], but the [[Sorting Hat]] won in the end, and Sorted him into Gryffindor.&lt;ref name="hatstall"&gt;{{WW|hatstall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neville was so nervous that when the Sorting Hat shouted out his house, he ran across the [[Great Hall]] with the Hat still on his head; he had to return to the stool to hand the Hat to the next student.&lt;ref name="PS7"&gt;{{PS|B|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the way to Gryffindor Tower after the [[Welcoming Feast]], Neville had a bundle of walking sticks dropped on his head by [[Peeves]] the Poltergeist.

[[File:Flying_class_in_1991.jpg|250px|thumb|Neville losing control of his broom during his first [[Flying (class)|flying lesson]]]]
Much of his first year was plagued by similar mishaps. In his first [[Potions (class)|Potions]] lesson, Neville melted [[Seamus Finnigan]]'s cauldron, and was subsequently drenched in the boil-curing potion they had been brewing.&lt;ref name="PS8"&gt;{{PS|B|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, in his first flying lesson with [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]], Neville accidentally broke his wrist after falling off his broom from a great height; afraid of being left behind on the ground, he had pushed off too early. He was taken to the hospital wing and his wrist was healed. Several hours later, he ended up heading to the [[Trophy Room|Hogwarts Trophy Room]] with Harry, Ron, and Hermione for Harry's duel with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Nearly getting caught by Filch, they end up in the forbidden third floor corridor, where Neville drew Harry's attention to a giant three-headed dog. They manage to escape and safely return to Gryffindor Tower.&lt;ref name="PS9" /&gt;

That year, Neville received a [[Remembrall]] from his grandmother as a gift which was flown in by an [[owl]]. This particular gift later allowed Harry Potter to become Gryffindor seeker. Draco Malfoy threw the small sphere into the air, and Harry flew to grab it, standing up for Neville. [[Minerva McGonagall]] saw how easily Harry retrieved the ball and asked him to join the team.&lt;ref name="PS9"&gt;{{PS|B|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Christmas holidays, Neville was the target of a cruel prank by Draco Malfoy, in which his legs were stuck together with the [[Leg-Locker Curse]]. Neville had to bunny-hop all the way to [[Gryffindor Tower]] so someone could perform the counter-curse. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him to report Malfoy, Neville replied that he didn't want more trouble. Harry gave Neville his last [[Chocolate Frog]] from Christmas and consoled him by telling that he was worth twelve Malfoys, and that the Sorting Hat chose him for Gryffindor, while Malfoy was in "''stinking [[Slytherin]]''". Several seconds later, Neville inadvertently helped the trio identify [[Nicolas Flamel]] when he gave Harry Dumbledore's collectible card from the Chocolate Frog.&lt;ref name="PS13"&gt;{{PS|B|13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harry-potter1-Quidditch cheering.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Neville cheering on the Gryffindor Quidditch Team during a match]]
Neville was sent to the hospital wing a third time after a [[Quidditch]] match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff. During the match, Malfoy began to taunt the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], as well as Neville. Neville challenged Malfoy on hearing this, and single-handedly took on Malfoy's friends [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]], while Ron fought Malfoy. Although he was knocked out by Crabbe and Goyle, [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] insisted that Neville would make a full recovery. This was the first time that Neville stood up for himself.&lt;ref name="PS14"&gt;{{PS|B|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, Neville learned about Harry and Hermione's attempt to take [[Norberta|Norbert]] the [[Norwegian Ridgeback]] up to the [[Astronomy Tower]] to send to Ron's brother [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]]. When he learned Malfoy was trying to get them caught, Neville snuck out of Gryffindor Tower to find them and warn them. He instead ended up getting caught by [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. He lost fifty House points, and was put in detention with Harry, Hermione, and Malfoy. Sent into the [[Forbidden Forest]] with Hagrid to search for an injured unicorn, Neville and Malfoy went along one path with [[Fang]], while the other three took another. When Malfoy snuck up behind Neville and grabbed him to scare him, Neville panicked and sent up wand sparks to warn Hagrid. When Hagrid learned the truth, he instead paired Neville with himself and Hermione.&lt;ref name="PS15"&gt;{{PS|B|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PetrificusTotalus PS.gif|250px|thumb|[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] casting the Full Body-Bind Curse on Neville|alt=]]
The night [[Quirinus Quirrell]] attempted to steal the [[Philosopher's Stone]], Neville followed Harry's advice and attempted to stop Harry, Ron, and Hermione from sneaking out, though he did not know what they were trying to do. However, he thought that they should not be breaking rules and risking that Gryffindor would lose more points, and blocked the portrait hole, willing to fight them to make them stay. Hermione apologised and struck Neville with a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] so that she, Harry, and Ron could leave. This was another early instance where Neville showed bravery, standing up to his only friends.&lt;ref name="PS16"&gt;{{PS|B|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For standing up to the trio, Neville won ten points for [[Gryffindor]] at the end-of-term feast. Having moments before, tied Slytherin for the [[House Cup]], this pushed Gryffindor into undisputed first place. In the final exams, he scored well in [[Herbology]], making up for his poor marks in Potions.&lt;ref name="PS17"&gt;{{PS|B|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second year====
{{Quote|You'd better open it, Ron. It'll be worse if you don't. My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and — it was horrible.|Neville telling Ron about Howlers|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:PixiesWreakingHavoc.gif|250px|thumb|left|Neville and his classmates in Gilderoy Lockhart's first [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson|alt=]]
In [[1992]], after the [[Start-of-Term Feast]], he applauded Harry and Ron for [[Flying Ford Anglia|flying a car]] to Hogwarts. The following morning when Ron received a [[Howler]] from his mother, Neville warned him to open it quickly.&lt;ref name="CS6"&gt;{{COS|B|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s first [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, a pair of "freshly caught" [[Pixie|Cornish pixies]] picked Neville up by the ears and hung him, by his cloak, from a chandelier. Moments later, he crashed back to the ground when the chandelier collapsed.&lt;ref name="CS6" /&gt;

After the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]] attack on [[Colin Creevey]], Neville feared that he might be attacked, due to his poor [[magic]]al skills, and tried to protect himself by purchasing a large, "''evil-smelling''" green onion, a [[pointed purple crystal]], and a rotting newt tail. However the other students pointed out that Neville should be all right; he was a [[pure-blood]] and thus unlikely to be attacked. However, he thought he was very close to being a [[Squib]] and was still in danger anyway.&lt;ref name="CS11"&gt;{{COS|B|11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B2C11M2 Great Hall Duelling Club.png|250px|thumb|The first and last meeting of the Duelling Club that Neville attended|alt=]]
Neville attended the first (and only) meeting of Lockhart's [[Duelling Club]]. To practise the [[Disarming Charm]], Neville was paired with [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]]. When Lockhart suggested the pair to volunteer spell blocking, Snape shot this down, claiming that Neville had difficulty with the simplest spells, and they would have to send what was left of Justin to the hospital wing in a matchbox.&lt;ref name="CS11" /&gt;

Shortly after [[Valentine's Day]], Neville informed Harry that his belongings had been searched by [[Ginevra Weasley|someone]].&lt;ref name="CS14"&gt;{{COS|B|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neville would have been present at the end of term feast that year, having thankfully not been attacked or petrified by the Basilisk, and would have been present when all his classmates who had been petrified returned to full health after being cured by [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]]s, and would have been there to greet [[Rubeus Hagrid]] following his release from [[Azkaban]]. 

====Third year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Severus Snape|Possibly no one's warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless [[Hermione Granger|Miss Granger]] is hissing instructions in his ear.|Remus Lupin|I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation, and I am sure he will perform it admirably.|A reference to Neville's skill as a wizard|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Dementor on Hogwarts Express.png|250px|thumb|left|Dementors entering the compartment that the [[trio]], Neville, Ginny, and Professor Lupin were in|alt=]]
On the train ride to Hogwarts for his third year, Neville became alarmed when the [[Hogwarts Express]] simply stopped. He entered the compartment Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] were in to find out what had happened. A [[Dementor]] then entered the compartment, negatively affecting all the students within, though to varying degrees. Then new [[Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] gave them chocolate telling them it would help them feel better about the shock. After arriving at [[Hogsmeade]] Station, Neville told people about the experience in the compartment.&lt;ref name="PA5"&gt;{{POA|B|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made its way to [[Draco Malfoy]], who taunted Harry about fainting.&lt;ref name="PA6"&gt;{{POA|B|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their first [[Divination]] class, Neville accidentally broke two of [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]]'s tea cups while reading tea leaves. As the class departed, Professor Trelawney warned him that he would be late next class and urged him to work hard to catch up with everyone else. In [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class, Neville practised bowing to a [[hippogriff]]; he constantly backed away from the [[beast]], which did not seem to want to bow back.&lt;ref name="PA6" /&gt;

The next day in [[Potions (class)|Potions]], Neville again managed to earn the ire of [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. He somehow was able to turn his [[Shrinking Solution]] orange instead of green. To ensure Neville would get the [[potion]] right, Snape told him that he would feed some of it to Neville's pet [[toad]], [[Trevor]], at the end of the class. Desperately, he asked Hermione for help; she whispered instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth. By the end of class, he was able to turn his potion green, and successfully shrunk Trevor from a toad to a tadpole. Upon returning Trevor to his proper size, Snape took five points from Hermione simply to spite the [[Gryffindor]]s.&lt;ref name="PA7"&gt;{{POA|B|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neville's boggart.gif|250px|thumb|Neville's [[Boggart]], [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]|alt=]]
Later that day, Neville helped Professor Remus Lupin's first practical [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson about boggarts. Neville was the first person to be asked. This was most likely because of Professor Lupin's preference for the underdog and him wanting to build Neville's confidence. When asked what scared him most in the world, Neville replied "''Professor Snape''", to which everyone found amusing. To counter the boggart, Lupin asked Neville to picture Snape in his grandmother's clothes. For his help, Neville earned ten points for Gryffindor and he confidently banished the boggart at the end of class.&lt;ref name="PA7" /&gt;

[[File:Gryffindor common room 1993.jpg|250px|thumb|left|McGonagall and the residents of [[Gryffindor Tower]] in the common room after Sirius Black's break-in|alt=]]
In the spring of [[1994]], Neville lost the passwords to [[Gryffindor Tower]]; because [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]] changed them so frequently, Neville needed to write them down so he could remember them.&lt;ref name="PA12"&gt;{{POA|B|12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the passwords disappeared, [[Sirius Black]] managed to enter Gryffindor Tower with a knife. After learning Neville was indirectly responsible, Professor McGonagall banned him from all future visits into [[Hogsmeade]] for the remainder of the school year, gave him a detention, and forbade anyone from giving him the password to the common room, thus he had to wait outside the portrait until someone came by while security trolls hired to guard the Fat Lady leered unpleasantly at him. 

But none of that compared to what his grandmother had in store for him. Two days later during breakfast, Neville received a [[Howler]] from her; he tore out of the [[Great Hall]], amid shouts of laughter, and opened it in the [[Entrance Hall]], where his grandmother's angry voice told him he brought shame to their family.&lt;ref name="PA14"&gt;{{POA|B|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of his Divination final exam, Neville was told that, if he told anyone his results, he would suffer a serious accident.&lt;ref name="PA16"&gt;{{POA|B|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fourth year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|Neville, are you all right?|Neville|Oh, yes, I'm fine. Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what's for eating?|Neville in an "unnaturally high voice" after a lesson on the Unforgivable Curses|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
In 1994, Neville met up with Harry, Ron, and Hermione on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. He jealously listened to their recap of the [[Quidditch World Cup]]; his grandmother had not wanted to go, and did not purchase tickets.&lt;ref name="GF11"&gt;{{GOF|B|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awestruck by Ron's miniature figurine of Viktor Krum.&lt;ref name="GF11" /&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-screencaps.com-3041.jpg|250px|thumb|"Moody" demonstrating the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on a spider|alt=]]
In [[Alastor Moody|"Mad-Eye" Moody]]'s first [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class, Neville was able to supply information about the [[Unforgivable Curses]], in particular the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. When Moody demonstrated the curse on a spider, Neville was terrified; he gripped his desk so hard, his knuckles turned white. Hermione noticed this and called for the professor to stop. After class, Moody — who was in fact [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], one of the attackers of Neville's parents, under disguise by use of [[Polyjuice Potion]] — took Neville to his office for a cup of tea.

Having heard from [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] about Neville's aptitude in [[Herbology]], Moody cheered Neville up by telling him what Sprout had said and gave him a number of books he thought Neville would enjoy. One of them was ''[[Magical Mediterranean Water-Plants and Their Properties|Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean]]'', which Crouch intended for Harry to read in order to learn all about [[Gillyweed]] for the second task&lt;ref name="GF14"&gt;{{GOF|B|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but he was stubbornly searching through the library.&lt;ref name="GF26"&gt;{{GOF|B|26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later in class, Neville was put under the [[Imperius Curse]] by Moody, under the pretence of letting the class know what it felt like. Under Moody's influence, Neville performed a series of "''quite astonishing gymnastics''" that he could not have performed normally.&lt;ref name="GF15"&gt;{{GOF|B|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yule_ball2.gif|250px|thumb|left|Neville and Ginny Weasley at the [[Yule Ball]]|alt=]]
When the Yule Ball was announced during the [[Triwizard Tournament]], Neville asked Hermione to go with him. After Hermione politely declined, having already agreed to attend with [[Viktor Krum]], Neville asked [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]. While the pair seemed to enjoy themselves, Neville accidentally stepped on Ginny's toes while dancing.&lt;ref name="GF23"&gt;{{GOF|B|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be assumed that Neville was among the spectators of the third task ([[Triwizard Maze]]), supporting Harry along with his fellow Gryffindors. He was also most likely among the mass of students that attended the [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory]], after Cedric was murdered on the orders of Lord Voldemort.

====Fifth year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Neville|We were all in the D.A. together. It was all supposed to be about fighting You-Know-Who, wasn't it? And this is the first chance we've had to do something real — or was that all just a game or something?|Harry Potter|No — of course it wasn't —|Then we should come too. We want to help.|Neville insisting on going with the trio to the [[Department of Mysteries]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Fifth year Hogwarts carriage.jpg|250px|thumb|Neville with the trio and Luna on the school's carriages]]
In 1995, Neville met with Harry and Ginny on the Hogwarts Express. Searching for seats, the trio entered [[Luna Lovegood]]'s compartment. Once inside, he excitedly showed them his [[Mimbulus mimbletonia]], a birthday present from his [[Algie Longbottom|great-uncle Algie]]. He told them about his plans to show it to Professor Sprout, as well as wanting to breed it.&lt;ref name="OP10"&gt;{{OOTP|B|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After arriving at Hogwarts, Neville helped Harry get into Gryffindor Tower as Harry had not learned the new password yet, and then defended Harry during a verbal fight with [[Seamus Finnigan]], claiming that the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' was going downhill, not Harry and Dumbledore. He and his grandmother both believed Harry's claim that Voldemort had returned, and had cancelled their subscription to the newspaper.&lt;ref name="OP11"&gt;{{OOTP|B|11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OOTP DA Neville Disarming Parvati.gif|250px|thumb|left|Neville finally mastering the Disarming Charm during a D.A. meeting]]
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione began organising [[Dumbledore's Army]], Neville was among the first to sign up. At their first meeting in the [[Room of Requirement]], Neville was left partner-less when they began practice; Neville instead partnered with Harry. After successfully disarming Harry, Neville then joined Ron and Hermione, so Harry could check on the others.&lt;ref name="OP18"&gt;{{OOTP|B|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Harry's encouragement, by the beginning of Christmas break, Neville had improved "''beyond all recognition''."&lt;ref name="OP21"&gt;{{OOTP|B|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B5C23M1 Christmas at St Mungo's.png|250px|thumb|right|Neville and his grandmother visiting St Mungo's]]
During Christmas break, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny learned that Neville's parents were not dead, but patients in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], having gone insane after being tortured by a group of Death Eaters at the end of the [[First Wizarding War]]. Harry was the only one who already knew this, having found out in the [[Pensieve]] in 1994, but he had told no one, keeping Neville's secret safe. Before Neville left, his mother handed him an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper; while his grandmother wanted him to throw it away, Neville instead pocketed it.&lt;ref name="OP23"&gt;{{OOTP|B|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was learned that ten [[Death Eaters]] escaped from Azkaban in 1996, including three of the ones responsible for the torture of Neville's parents, Neville did not speak of it, but it "''wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change''" in him, according to Harry. He worked harder than anyone in D.A. meetings, and was the fastest to pick up new spells aside from Hermione.&lt;ref name="OP25"&gt;{{OOTP|B|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When on [[18 June]] Harry had a vision that [[Sirius Black]] was tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], he informed Ron and Hermione. The latter convinced Harry to check to see if Sirius was at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] before rushing off to rescue him, and Ginny and Luna came to their assistance. Harry and Hermione broke into Umbridge's office, and Ron wanted to trick Umbridge, Ginny and Luna stopped people from entering the corridor. Umbridge unfortunately wasn't fooled and ordered the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] to round them up. Neville, seeing what is going on, tried to help, but he was caught as well.&lt;ref name="OP32"&gt;{{OOTP|B|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thestral on air.gif|250px|thumb|left|Neville riding on a [[Thestral]]s on the way to the Department of Mysteries]]
When Harry and Hermione lured Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest, Neville, Ron, Ginny, and Luna stayed alone with the Inquisitorial Squad. Neville and others broke free using skills that they had acquired in their D.A. sessions; Neville used good [[Impediment Jinx]]. They then regrouped with Harry and Hermione, who had left Umbridge with a group of enraged centaurs. He, Ron, Ginny and Luna joined Harry and Hermione, who had left Umbridge at the grace of infuriated centaurs. They fly via [[Thestral]]s to London, despite Harry's reluctance to let them accompany him.&lt;ref name="OP33"&gt;{{OOTP|B|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neville threatening Bellatrix GIF.gif|250px|thumb|Neville meeting Bellatrix Lestrange face-to-face in the Hall of Prophecy|alt=]]
Once in the [[Hall of Prophecy|Hall of Prophecies]], Harry was drawn to an orb that had his name on it. Neville and Hermione urged him not to remove it; once Harry had, the group was confronted by Death Eaters.&lt;ref name="OP34"&gt;{{OOTP|B|34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent battle, Neville accompanied Harry and Hermione. They run into the [[Time Room]], where he disarmed [[Rabastan Lestrange]] who was struggling with Harry, accidentally disarming Harry as well. Wanting to fix his mistake he tried to stun Lestrange, but he hit a rack full of [[Time-Turner|time-turners]]. Escaping from room he was hit by [[Impediment Jinx]] by [[Antonin Dolohov]] and [[Jugson]], same as Harry and Hermione. 

When Hermione casted [[Silencing Charm]] on Dolohov and Harry placed Jugson under [[Full Body-Bind Curse|Full Body-Bind]], Dolohov cursed Hermione. Taking advantage of the moment Neville crawled from under the desk, but Dolohov broke Neville's nose and wand, so Harry placed Dolohov under Full Body-Bind. Neville refused Harry's suggestion that he leave with an incapacitated Hermione to go get help, instead carrying her while he and Harry searched for Ron, Ginny, and Luna. When several Death Eaters cornered Harry alone in the [[Death Chamber]], Neville stormed into the room to aid him, armed with Hermione's wand, but due to his broken nose, was unable to pronounce spells correctly.&lt;ref name="OP35"&gt;{{OOTP|B|35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix_neville_bellatrix.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]] threatening Neville during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries|alt=]]
When another Death Eater seized Neville, Bellatrix Lestrange briefly tortured Neville with the [[Cruciatus Curse]], both to try to make Harry hand over [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|the prophecy]] and to see how long Neville held out before "cracking" like his parents. Even under the threat of being tortured (possibly even going insane like his parents), Neville told Harry not to hand the prophecy over.&lt;ref name="OP35" /&gt;

After the [[Order of the Phoenix]] members arrived, Harry tried to get out with Neville, but Harry was stopped by [[Walden Macnair]]. Harry urged Neville to run, but Neville refused, instead breaking Macnair's grip on Harry by jabbing the Death Eater in the eye with Hermione's wand. Then Neville was strucked with [[Dancing Feet Spell]] by Dolohov, but Harry placed Dolohov under Body-Bind.&lt;ref name="OP36"&gt;{{OOTP|B|36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moments later they were attacked by [[Lucius Malfoy]]. Harry throw Neville the prophecy to cast Impediment Jinx on Malfoy. As Harry pulled Neville up a flight of stairs, Neville accidentally smashed the prophecy. As the battle continued, Neville alerted Harry to the appearance of [[Albus Dumbledore]]. The battle soon ended, and Neville and his friends were transported back to Hogwarts, where Neville's nose was fixed by [[Poppy Pomfrey]].&lt;ref name="OP38"&gt;{{OOTP|B|38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry soon learned the contents of the prophecy from Dumbledore. As both Neville and Harry were born at the close of [[July]] to parents who had all escaped Voldemort three times, they both qualified for the prophecy child. However, Dumbledore believed that the prophecy did indeed refer to Harry, not Neville, as [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] marked Harry as his equal by attacking him.&lt;ref name="ootp37" /&gt;

Neville's grandmother purchased him a new wand, 13" cherry wood, with a unicorn hair core, from [[Garrick Ollivander]] before his sixth year.

[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-romilda, lavender, and Demelza.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Neville at the 1996 Start-of-Term Feast]]
On 1 September, 1996, Neville sat with [[Harry Potter]] and [[Luna Lovegood]] on the Hogwarts Express, where both of them expressed disappointment that Harry did not plan to continue D.A. meetings during their sixth year. When [[Romilda Vane]], a younger [[Gryffindor]] student, invited Harry to come to her compartment and implicitly insulted Neville and Luna, Harry coldly rebuffed her, emphasising that Neville and Luna were among his closest and most loyal friends. Neville was later invited to join [[Horace Slughorn]], the new [[Potions Master]], in his train compartment. Slughorn was searching for new students to add to his [[Slug Club]], but Neville didn't seem to meet Slughorn's requirements.&lt;ref name="HBP7"&gt;{{HBP|B|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-lavender neville.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Neville behind Lavender Brown in the [[Gryffindor Common Room]]]]
Neville also achieved four known O.W.L.s: one '[[Outstanding]]', two '[[Exceeds Expectations]]', and one '[[Acceptable]]'. The classes he were cleared to take were [[Herbology]], [[Charms (class)|Charms]], and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Professor McGonagall informed him that the 'Acceptable' grade he achieved in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] was not good enough for [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level, and he would not be able to keep up with the course work. McGonagall also stated that Professor Sprout would be delighted to see Neville back with an 'Outstanding' Herbology O.W.L.. He told her he only applied for Transfiguration for his grandmother's desires, but McGonagall stated it was time for Augusta to be proud of the grandson she had, as opposed to the one she desired. She let him down gently on his application on Transfiguration, and instead encouraged him to take Charms.&lt;ref name="HBP9"&gt;{{HBP|B|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Battle of the Astronomy Tower}}
[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|The funeral of Albus Dumbledore|alt=]]
Towards the end of the school year, Neville participated in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. Along with Luna Lovegood, he was the only member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] to reply to the summons via the coins. Neville stood guard outside the [[Room of Requirement]] with Ron and Ginny, waiting for [[Draco Malfoy]], who evaded them by using [[Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder]]. Neville suffered an injury that kept him in the hospital wing for some time, though he was able to attend the funeral of [[Albus Dumbledore]] shortly afterwards, where Luna helped him into his seat.&lt;ref name="HBP30"&gt;{{HBP|B|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neville on hogwarts express.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Neville scorning Death Eaters searching for Harry Potter on the Hogwarts Express]]
On 1 August, 1997, [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] took over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. While [[Muggle-born]]s were rounded up and Harry, Ron, and Hermione went on the run to search for Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es, Neville returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and, along with Ginny and Luna, restarted [[Dumbledore's Army]]. The D.A. opposed the new headmaster, [[Severus Snape]], and the two new Death Eater professors, Alecto and [[Amycus Carrow]], who taught anti-[[Non-magic people|Muggle]] propaganda and the [[Dark Arts]]. Neville got in trouble with the Carrows for refusing to practise the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on other students as a method of punishment, as well as for standing up against their bigotry and cruelty.

The revived D.A. helped protect fellow students from being bullied by the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] teachers, and generally rebelled against authority, such as writing "''Dumbledore's Army, still recruiting''" on the Hogwarts walls and freeing students from detention. Neville, Luna and Ginny also attempted to steal [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's sword]] from Snape's office, but were caught on the way out. In his own way to subvert the Carrows' manner of discipline, Snape only gave them a detention, sending them into the [[Forbidden Forest]] with [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. Neville eventually decided to cease their open rebellion after [[Michael Corner]] was caught and brutally tortured for freeing a chained-up first year.

[[File:Neville battered.jpg|220px|thumb|A battered Neville, after being brutally punished by the Carrows]]
Neville was eventually left alone to lead the rebellion efforts, as Luna was dragged off the [[Hogwarts Express]] by Death Eaters around Christmas of 1997 to coerce her father into ceasing his political dissidence in ''[[The Quibbler]]'', and Ginny did not return to Hogwarts following the Easter holidays, as her family went into hiding following Harry, Ron, and Hermione's [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|escape from Malfoy Manor]]. By this time, the Carrows were aware of Neville's role in the rebellion, and he suffered beatings and torture. The [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] also targeted Neville's grandmother to try to intimidate him, but she evaded capture and went on the run.

Eventually, the Carrows realised that Neville was the main ringleader and decided that Hogwarts could do without him. Fearing that they may kill him, Neville made for the [[Room of Requirement]], which he was able to turn into a hiding place for the D.A., and to connect to the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]] in order to get food from [[Aberforth Dumbledore]]. By May, most of the D.A. had taken to living there.&lt;ref name="DH29"&gt;{{DH|B|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]=====
{{Quote|The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.|Neville discussing the resistance to the Carrows at Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Trio in hogsmeade.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The trio and Neville in the [[Hog's Head Inn]]]]
On [[2 May]], [[1998]] Neville enthusiastically greeted [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and led them from the Hog's Head into the [[Room of Requirement]]. While in the tunnel he explained to the trio the nature of his injuries and the reign of the Carrows at Hogwarts. He also informed the trio that the D.A. had been reinstated and was currently resisting the new regime. Believing that their return meant the overthrow of the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] professors, Neville signalled the rest of the D.A. to return to Hogwarts.&lt;ref name="DH30"&gt;{{DH|B|30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As students returned, along with the [[Order of the Phoenix]], Voldemort and his Death Eater army approached, laying siege to the school in the hopes of capturing Harry Potter.&lt;ref name="DH31"&gt;{{DH|B|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first round of battle, Neville used various plants to attack Death Eaters, and helped transport the injured and dead when a temporary cease-fire was called. He briefly spoke to Harry, who told him that it was top priority to kill [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[snake]] and [[Horcrux]], [[Nagini]].&lt;ref name="DH34"&gt;{{DH|B|34}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Death Eaters approached with a "dead" Harry, Neville stood up in defiance of Voldemort. He was subsequently forced to wear the [[Sorting Hat]] as it [[Fire-Making Spell|burned]] because he refused to join Voldemort. Fortunately, due to Harry's sacrifice, Neville was able to shrug off the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] with relative ease.&lt;ref name="DH36" /&gt;

[[File:Neville kills Nagini.gif|250px|thumb|Neville slaying [[Nagini]] with the Sword of Gryffindor]]
Because of his tremendous bravery shown on the battlefield, Neville was able to pull the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] from the burning hat, in the process proving himself a true [[Gryffindor]], something that was doubted constantly throughout due to his apparently weak-willed, shy, and bumbling nature. In a single stroke, he carried out Harry's final order, slaying Nagini, destroying Voldemort's last remaining [[Horcrux]]. Neville subsequently teamed up with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] as the defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters were forced into the [[Great Hall]] and defeated [[Fenrir Greyback]]. Also during the Battle Neville duelled [[Scabior]] on the Covered Bridge. Scabior fell to his death when the bridge fell down.&lt;ref name="DH36"&gt;{{DH|B|36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neville witnessed Harry's final defeat of Voldemort and survived the [[Second Wizarding War]].

====Career at Hogwarts====
[[File:Professor Longbottom.png|250px|thumb|left|Neville Longbottom as a Hogwarts professor]]
Neville briefly worked as an [[Auror]], immediately following the war.&lt;ref name="PotterCast"&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1217-pottercast-anelli.html "PotterCast Interviews J.K. Rowling, part one."] PotterCast #130, 17 December 2007 on accio-quote.org&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime afterwards, he either sent an application to or was offered a place on the Hogwarts staff by [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] [[Minerva McGonagall]], and ultimately landed a teaching job in the [[Herbology department]],&lt;ref name="DHEpilogue" /&gt; under [[Head of Herbology|Head of Department]], [[Pomona Sprout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WU}} ([https://wizardsunitehub.info/profession-skill/from-seed-to-tree/ see here])&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout his new career, his students would come to be impressed whenever he showed them his Dumbledore's Army coin, which he and other [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members kept as a keepsake and had come to be seen as something of a badge of honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/default.aspx?sec=3 Bloomsbury Live Chat]&lt;/ref&gt; Neville also became the [[Head of Gryffindor House]] after McGonagall went on to be [[Hogwarts Headmaster|Headmistress]].&lt;ref name="MA October" /&gt;

=====[[2008–2009 school year]]=====
[[File:Neville Longbottom during Sorting Ceremony MA.png|250px|thumb|right|Professor Longbottom during the Sorting Ceremony]]
Neville was present at the [[Sorting Ceremony]] in [[2008]], seated alongside his former professors and fellow [[Head of House|Heads of House]] Pomona Sprout, [[Filius Flitwick]] and [[Horace Slughorn]]. After the term began, due to a mishap caused by a group of students, including [[Ivy Warrington]] who cast the [[Vanishing Spell]] and Vanished a [[suit of armour]], Neville gave them detention, which was to polish the rest of the suits of armour without magic.&lt;ref name="MA"&gt;{{MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neville introducing Harry to students MA.png|250px|thumb|left|Neville introducing Harry to students]]
Later in the school year, during a detention session, Neville introduced his old friend [[Harry Potter]] to the students when he visited the school. When an [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|unidentified student]] realised they had seen Harry at [[King's Cross Station]], Harry remarked they had been very confused, which Neville thought would happen to the best of them. Harry and Neville also recalled the numerous adventures they had gone through when they were in school, and Neville remarked that despite the experiences, they always tried to stay out of trouble, but he and Harry knew it couldn't have been true, which was also reflected on their faces. Neville then walked Harry out when he decided to leave.&lt;ref name="MA" /&gt;

=====[[2010–2011 school year]]=====
[[File:Neville catching up students after duel in Hogsmeade MA.png|250px|thumb|right|Neville catching up with students after their duel with the masked wizard]]
During the first [[Hogsmeade weekend trips|Hogsmeade weekend trip]] in the 2010–2011 school year, Neville caught up with Ivy Warrington, [[Daniel Page]] and [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|another student]] after they [[Attack in Hogsmeade|fought]] a [[Elliot Evers|masked wizard]] following a magical display that damaged a tree. He prompted Ivy to go to the [[Hospital Wing]] to fix her broken arm and the others to visit the [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] to tell the story, before noticing some red origami birds landing near them, which were signed by [[Nocturnal Order of Tricks and Magical Exhibitions|NOTME]]. He cast some spells to mend the damaged tree.&lt;ref name="MA" /&gt;

[[File:Linderina Crane indicating Neville Longbottom's height MA.png|250px|thumb|left|Linderina Crane gesturing Neville's height]]
Later in [[Herbology]] class when he was teaching ''[[Mimbulus mimbletonia]]'' to [[Third year|third-year]] students, he was interrupted by [[Linderina Crane]] who came to investigate his role in the Hogsmeade incident, but since the last spells he had cast were for mending the tree in Hogsmeade, the [[Reverse Spell]] couldn't reveal anything related to damaging it even if he had done such a thing, and so the investigation was inconclusive.&lt;ref name="MA" /&gt;

[[File:Linderina Crane interrupting Neville's class again MA.png|250px|thumb|right|Linderina Crane interrupting Neville's class again]]
He was interrupted again by Crane in another class when talking about [[vampiric vegetation]], and was asked about [[Neville Longbottom's storeroom|his storeroom]]. Though he denied there could be anything fishy going on, Crane still intended to check it out.&lt;ref name="MA" /&gt;

[[File:Neville attacked by Dementor MA.png|250px|thumb|left|Neville attacked by a Dementor]]
At some point amidst all this, [[Dementor]]s initiated an attack on [[Hogwarts Castle]]. Neville was their first victim, being attacked by a Dementor when he was picking herbs with students in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. [[Rubeus Hagrid]] arrived soon enough and took Neville to the [[Hospital Wing]]. After he recovered, he participated in the [[Siege of Hogwarts|all-out battle]] that followed.&lt;ref name="MA" /&gt;

[[File:Neville talking with students about Mimbulus mimbletonia MA.png|250px|thumb|right|Neville talking about the ''Mimbulus mimbletonia'']]
Neville enlisted some students to help with caring for his ''Mimbulus mimbletonia'' over the winter. It bloomed in spring, and he held a [[Blooming Party]] for it. Everyone there cast the [[Bubble-Head Charm]] on themselves to block the foul odour of [[Stinksap]], except Neville who had long grown accustomed to the smell.&lt;ref name="MA" /&gt;

[[File:Neville controlled by Victor Gridley MA.png|250px|thumb|left|Neville controlled by Victor Gridley]]
Unbeknownst to him, [[Victor Gridley]] and his associate [[Pronk|Mr Pronk]] had been sneaked into Hogwarts by [[Daniel Page]] and attended his party in disguise. When [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|another knowing student]] returned Gridley to his original look, he summoned Mr Pronk and kidnapped Neville. Gridley subsequently interrogated Neville, and found that he was genuinely ignorant about NOTME and his business affairs. He was put in the dungeon of [[Victor Gridley's caravan|Gridley's caravan]] along with Daniel's sister [[Esme Page|Esme]].&lt;ref name="MA" /&gt;

[[File:Neville punching Gridley unconscious MA.png|250px|thumb|right|Neville punching Gridley unconscious]]
Neville remained unconscious when [[Daniel Page]], [[Ivy Warrington]] and [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|their friend]] arrived at the caravan dungeon to save him and Esme. At the end of their [[Skirmish in Victor Gridley's caravan dungeon|fight]] with Gridley and his [[Dementor]]s, Neville's wand was taken by Gridley, who had had his own wand snapped in half by Daniel, but Neville then awakened and knocked Gridley out with his bare fist, ending the confrontation. Neville saw Esme's injuries and suggested she be treated at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] which had wonderful [[Healer]]s.&lt;ref name="MA" /&gt;

====Marriage====
{{Dialogue a-b|Ginny Potter|Don't forget to give Neville our love!|James Sirius|Mum! I can't give a professor ''love''...|Ginny and her son exchange goodbyes at [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9¾]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Sometime before [[2014]], he married his former classmate and D.A. member [[Hannah Abbott]]. The pair lived at the [[Leaky Cauldron]], where she became the landlady.&lt;ref name="hannah"&gt;[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more "J. K. Rowling at Carnegie Hall Reveals Dumbledore is Gay; Neville Marries Hannah Abbott, and Much More"] at The Leaky Cauldron.org&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah had retired from being landlady as of 2014, she and Neville were childless and scathingly reported by [[Rita Skeeter]] as "''enjoying a little more Ogden's Firewhisky than most would expect from custodians of our children''".&lt;ref&gt;{{PM}} - [[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL]] (Archived)&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this was true or simply another scandalous rumour from Rita Skeeter is unknown. It was reported by Rita Skeeter that Neville was the godfather of Harry's second son, [[Albus Potter]].

Over the years, he remained in contact with his old friends, as in [[2017]], Ginny told her and Harry's [[James Potter II|eldest son]] "''to give Neville their love''" when he arrived at Hogwarts.&lt;ref name="DHEpilogue" /&gt;

====The Calamity====
In the late [[2010s]] and early [[2020s]], Neville aided members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] who pursued a profession as a Professor by showing them a mental trick to make casting the [[Deterioration Hex]] seem as a second nature to profoundly increase its effects, while he also instructed the Magizoologists how to use the [[Bravery Charm]] to devastating effect. Neville also sent an [[owl]] to a [[Calamity Investigator]] working for the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] advising them that [[bitter root]] should be dried for several days before use, making it more potent and thus reducing the brewing time for the Calamity Investigator's [[Exstimulo Potion]]s. 

He also later contacted the same Calamity Investigator to inform them that stroking, talking, and singing to plants encouraged their growth, with the Calamity Investigator later using this information to discover that singing the greatest hits of [[Celestina Warbeck]] to [[Dittany]] greatly increased its potency, decreasing the brewing time for their [[Healing Potion]]s.&lt;ref name="WU"&gt;{{WU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fifth annual [[Vegetable Vault]] competition, which was held in [[Hogsmeade]], Neville collected the winning [[Leaping Toadstool]]s upon their crossing the finishing line, as these Leaping Toadstools were the most potent. He also spent time telling stories of his years at Hogwarts to the same Calamity Investigator in the [[Great Hall]], helping them to understand the castle more deeply and making it eaiser for them to return Hogwarts School Traces. Later, Neville spoke with the same Calamity Investigator regarding their [[Greenhouse Charm]] and provided improvements to the [[incantation]] and stance used when casting it. He later asked the same Calamity Investigator to procure [[Dragon dung|dung]] from an [[Antipodean Opaleye]] [[dragon]] to use as a potent fertiliser before discussing the properties of fertilisers with the Calamity Investigator.&lt;ref name="WU" /&gt;

Neville also later helped the same Calamity Investigator to create a successful system for distributing excess ingredients from wizarding Greenhouses, for which Neville made sure they were rightly compensated. He also held a mandatory [[Herbology]] lecture for members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, including the same Calamity Investigator, where he discussed better clipping techniques and allowed the Calamity Investigator to try them out.&lt;ref name="WU" /&gt;

==Physical appearance==
[[File:Neville Longbottom.jpg|200px|thumb|Neville in his [[sixth year]], age 16]]
Neville was said to strongly resemble [[Alice Longbottom|his mother]]. He was round-faced,&lt;ref name="PS6" /&gt; short, chubby, and had blond hair.&lt;ref&gt;Book canon has priority over films.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also somewhat buck-toothed. [[Pansy Parkinson]] had once called him "''fat''", but this may have been an exaggeration, as she frequently made disparaging comments about Gryffindor students.&lt;ref name="PS9" /&gt;

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b|Bellatrix Lestrange |Let's see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents... unless [[Harry Potter|Potter]] wants to give us the prophecy.|Neville|DON'D GIB ID DO DEM! DON'D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!|Neville defying Death Eaters with a broken nose|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

When he was younger, Neville was clumsy, forgetful, shy, and many considered him ill-suited for [[Gryffindor]] house because he seemed timid. However, Neville proved that the [[Sorting Hat]] had seen the bravery beneath his insecurity, as he stood up to his only friends as a first-year&lt;ref name="PS6" /&gt; and later became one of the [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]]'s most courageous members.&lt;ref name="OP18" /&gt; Part of Neville's problem seems to have been poor self-esteem, as he referred to himself as a "''nobody''" and "''almost a [[Squib]]''"&lt;ref name="CS11" /&gt; at times. This was likely caused by his grandmother's belief that he was not living up to his parents' accomplishments, and browbeating from fellow students and people like [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. Though he came from a pure-blood family, he held no prejudice against [[half-blood]]s or [[Muggle-born]]s.

Neville appeared to suffer from a degree of post-traumatic stress disorder, as the torture of a spider via the cruciatus curse by Barty Crouch Junior in disguise as [[Alastor Moody]] was enough to cause him a severe anxiety attack. This was likely due to his own experience with his parents being subjected to the curse's worst possible outcome: the onset of permanent and complete insanity. This familiarity of what the [[Cruciatus Curse]] could do in skilled enough hands was more than enough to terrify him.{{Quote|Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of [[Venomous Tentacula]], which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.|Neville fighting against the Death Eaters|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Neville plant.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Neville and his interest in Herbology]]
With the support of his friends, the encouragement of [[Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] to face his fears, and the motivation of knowing his parents' torturers were on the loose, Neville became braver, more self-assured, and dedicated to the fight against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his Death Eaters.&lt;ref name="OP25" /&gt; This was proven by his participation in many battles and his revival of the D.A. in the face of threats and torture at the hands of the [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow|Carrows]] in his seventh year, as well as his defiance of Voldemort himself during the [[Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]].&lt;ref name="DH29" /&gt;

Throughout the trials he faced over his seven years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Neville blossomed from a timid, self-deprecating, and generally nervous student into a stalwart soldier possessed of an ironclad will, courage of outstanding merit, and a nobility of spirit, despite still having a comical and shy but at the same time courageous and fierce personality. In many ways, Neville's transformation allowed him to change from a scaredy-cat into a lordly lion, becoming a ferocious defender of his fellow students during Voldemort's reign. Suffice it to say, Neville's appointment to Gryffindor House was well-deserved.

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|Apparently, [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] told [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Professor Moody]] I'm really good at Herbology.|Neville's talent in Herbology|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Neville was not an academically strong student in his early years, often requiring [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s help in class and with school-work. However (as confirmed by [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]]), part of this was likely caused by his use of another's wand, poor self-esteem, and anxiety caused by the incessant bullying from many of his peers and [[Severus Snape|Snape]]. When he found both courage and self-confidence in his later years, Neville's [[magic]]al skills as a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] grew and he proved to be a powerful wizard in his own right. 
*'''[[Herbology]]''': As confirmed by Professor Sprout, who taught Herbology at Hogwarts, Neville was particularly gifted at Herbology, with him seemingly being on par with [[Hermione Granger]] in this subject. In his first year, Neville's Herbology score was so good that it even compensated for his abysmal Potions grade, and he was the fastest worker in class: in [[1996]], he was the first to extract a pod from a [[Snargaluff]] plant.&lt;ref name="HBP11"&gt;{{HBP|B|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later scored an "[[Outstanding]]" on his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam,&lt;ref name="HBP9" /&gt; helped Professor Sprout with organising the defences around Hogwarts with [[Devil's Snare]], employed [[Mandrake]]s into the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] to attack the [[Death Eaters]], and even worked as the Hogwarts Professor of this subject himself after the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Neville's skills in Herbology would later serve him well in his brief career as an [[Auror]]. Neville would improve his already considerable skills in the field to the extent that he was eventually hired on as the new Herbology professor at Hogwarts, succeeding his mentor, Pomona Sprout.
{{Quote|He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving.|[[Harry Potter]] regarding Neville's performance in the D.A.|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Neville Riddikulus.gif|250px|thumb|Neville mastering the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]]]]
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Once properly motivated by [[Harry Potter]] during [[Dumbledore's Army]] meeting, and made more confident, Neville proved to be proficient in Defence Against the Dark Arts. Indeed, Neville even achieved an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' on his O.W.L. exam. This allowed him to advance to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level.&lt;ref name="HBP9"&gt;{{HBP|B|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neville's talent with defensive spells and [[Counter-curse]]s was also proven in the [[Second Wizarding War]] (which he survived), as well as his brief post-war work as an [[Auror]].
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Neville proved to be a surprisingly skilled and competent duellist after gaining the required confidence and motivation from his time in [[Dumbledore's Army]]: he survived both the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] without any serious injuries, and in the former, was notably the last person — apart from Harry Potter — standing until the [[Order of the Phoenix]] arrived to rescue them. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]&lt;ref name="DH31" /&gt; he defeated [[Fenrir Greyback]], along with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and was one of the survivors.&lt;ref name="DH36" /&gt; It was also highly likely that, due to his hands-on experience from serving as [[Auror]], Neville's skills in [[martial magic]] later increased considerably even further.
{{Quote|I see that you have an 'Exceeds Expectations' in Charms however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?|Minerva McGonagall acknowledging Neville's skill in the field of charms|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Neville proved to be proficient in charm-work. He earned an 'Exceeds Expectations' in the subject on his O.W.L. exam and progressed to N.EW.T.-level.&lt;ref name="HBP9"&gt;{{HBP|B|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Hermione, he mastered the [[Shield Charm]] more quickly than anyone in [[Dumbledore's Army]].&lt;ref name="OP25" /&gt; He could also effectively perform simpler charms, such as the [[Locking Spell]],&lt;ref name="OP34"&gt;{{OOTP|B|34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Banishing Charm]] (though his aim was initially imperfect with this spell). Neville could even produce a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]],&lt;ref name="OP27"&gt;{{OOTP|B|27}}&lt;/ref&gt; proving of his superior magical ability given the immense difficulty required with casting such an advanced and powerful protective charm. It was likely that he eventually managed to produce a full, corporeal Patronus, and also improved his general Charms work during his work as an Auror.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Though not excellent in this subject, [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] stated that Neville's work only lacked confidence. With that said, Neville managed to score an '[[Acceptable]]' on his Transfiguration O.W.L. However, he was unable to continue into the [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level.&lt;ref name="HBP9"&gt;{{HBP|B|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was likely that Neville's skills in the subject improved to some extent after his serving as an Auror, given how Transfiguration is commonly used in the job, and therefore he would have had more experience using it.
*'''Leadership skills''': During the [[1997–1998 school year]], Neville co-led [[Dumbledore's Army]] along side [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] and [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]]. His leadership proved to be so efficient, that the [[Death Eaters]] were forced to resort to attempting to control Neville through his grandmother, and he was forced to go into hiding in the [[Room of Requirement]]. Neville's leadership skills would later aid him in his career as the [[Herbology]] professor at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in his later life.
*'''Resourcefulness''': Neville was quite resourceful during a serious situation as during the 1997–1998 school year, he was able to use the Room of Requirement as a hideout for himself when the Carrow's cornered him and later for the other members of Dumbledore's Army. He was also knowledgeable enough to use it in a way to prevent Snape and the Carrow's from entering the room which ensured that they were safe until the Battle of Hogwarts.
*'''Teaching skills''': Neville developed good teaching skills as he grew older as he took over leading Dumbledore's Army alongside Ginny and Luna while Harry, Ron and Hermione were hunting for Voldemort's Horcruxes and presumably continued Harry's teaching of defensive spells alongside standing up to the Carrow's and Snape. Later on in life, he was eventually given a teaching position in the Herbology department at Hogwarts, and eventually succeeded his mentor Pomona Sprout as the main Herbology professor, suggesting that his teaching skills had improved by then.
*'''Indomitable willpower''': Despite his early lack of self confidence and difficulties with the bullying from [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Severus Snape]] and most of the [[Slytherin]] students, Neville was shown to have quite a strong willpower and an unbreakable spirit. This was first shown at the end of his [[1991–1992 school year|first year]], when he stood up to the [[trio]] and attempted to prevent them from sneaking out to the [[Underground Chambers]] as he didn't want to risk losing any more [[House points]] due to their disobedience. This courage grew as he gained self confidence over time. Later, during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] he stood up to [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] despite being tortured by her in response when she callously remarked that she had the pleasure of meeting and torturing both his parents, even though she was one of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s most powerful and loyal [[Death Eaters]] and was also the last person standing alongside Harry before the [[Order of the Phoenix]] arrived to rescue them. He again showed his indomitable willpower when the Death Eaters took control of Hogwarts, standing up to the [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow|Carrow's]] and Snape (unaware Snape was secretly still on their side) along with reforming [[Dumbledore's Army]], despite the torturous punishments he and many of the students received for opposing the Death Eater's regime. Neville later fought against the Death Eaters in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and stood up to Voldemort himself upon Harry's alleged death by refusing his offer to join him and the Death Eaters even when it appeared all was lost with Harry's supposed death, showing how much he had transformed since his earlier years. His defiance of Voldemort allowed him to destroy Voldemort's last remaining [[Horcrux]] [[Nagini]] and also allowed Harry to defeat Voldemort for the final time.

==Possessions==
[[File:Neville's wand.jpg|130px|thumb|Neville's second wand: 13", cherry wood, and unicorn hair core]]
*'''[[Neville Longbottom's first wand|First wand]]''': Neville's first wand was inherited from his father, Frank Longbottom. Its length, wood, and core material were unknown, and it was destroyed by [[Antonin Dolohov]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].
*'''[[Neville Longbottom's second wand|Second wand]]''': Neville's second wand was 13" long, made of [[Cherry (tree)|cherry]] [[Wand wood|wood]], and had a [[unicorn hair]] [[Wand core|core]]. This wand was manufactured by [[Garrick Ollivander]] sometime in or before [[1996]], and purchased from his wand shop [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]].
*'''[[Neville Longbottom's bedroom|Bedroom]]''': Neville's bedroom was located in Augusta Longbottom's house. Augusta once joked that he had been given enough wrappers by his mother to paper his bedroom.
[[File:Trevor PM.png|130px|thumb|Trevor, Neville's pet toad]]
*'''[[Trevor]]''': Trevor was Neville's pet [[toad]]. He was given to Neville by his Great-Uncle Algie upon Neville's gaining admission to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
[[File:Remembrall-neville.jpg|130px|thumb|Neville's Remembrall]]
*'''[[Remembrall]]''': Neville was gifted one these [[magic]]al items by his grandmother for the [[1991–1992 school year]], in an attempt to help him remember things, to counter his frequent absent-mindedness. His Remembrall would turn red in colour whenever he forgot something; the only trouble being, he could often not remember what he had even forgotten.
[[File:Mimblus.PNG|130px|thumb|Mimbulus Mimbletonia]]
*'''[[Mimbulus mimbletonia]]''': Neville was gifted a pot of this very rare magical plant for his birthday before the start of the [[1995–1996 school year]], due to his love and talent for [[Herbology]]. He was skilled in caring for this plant, and had knowledge of its species, including its [[Stinksap]].
*'''''[[Magical Mediterranean Water-Plants and Their Properties]]''''': Neville was gifted a copy of this [[Herbology]] book by [[Professor]] [[Bartemius Crouch Junior]] (then disguised as [[Alastor Moody]]) in [[1994]], in an attempt for him to inform [[Harry Potter]] about [[Gillyweed]] for the [[Triwizard Tournament]].
*'''''[[Winogrand's Wondrous Water Plants]]''''': Neville owned a copy of this [[Herbology]] book, at least since [[1994]], and kept it with him while hiding in the [[Room of Requirement]] in [[1998]] with [[Dumbledore's Army]].
*'''[[Pointed purple crystal]]''': Neville purchased one of these supposedly protective items during the [[1992–1993 school year]], when the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was [[Plot to open the Chamber of Secrets|re-opened]], to protect himself from the "[[Serpent of Slytherin|monster]]" within that was [[Petrification|attacking]] [[Muggle-born]] students. It was most likely completely useless and would have been of little utility to Neville, given that his status as a [[pure-blood]] made him a unlikely target. When this was pointed out to to him, he replied that [[Mrs Norris]] had also been a victim and believed that his (perceived) lack of ability made him little better than a [[squib]].

==Relationships==
===Family===
====Parents====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Augusta Longbottom|What's this? Haven't you told your friends about your parents, Neville? Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of! You should be proud, Neville, proud! They didn't give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, you know!|Neville Longbottom|I'm not ashamed.|Well, you've got a funny way of showing it!|Augusta telling Neville to be proud of his parents|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:Longbottom family portrait.png|250x250px|thumb|left|Frank and Alice with baby Neville|alt=]]
As Neville's parents, Alice and Frank Longbottom, had been permanent residents of [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] since Neville's infancy, he never knew them as the popular and talented Aurors they were reputed to be. Nevertheless, he held them in high esteem, much like his friend Harry looked up to the parents he never knew.

Neville regularly visited his parents at St Mungo's with his grandmother, where he tried to speak to them and brought them sweets, keeping the wrappers his mother handed back to him, even when his grandmother told him to throw them in the bin.&lt;ref name="OP23" /&gt; Their torture clearly haunted him, as he was badly shaken by seeing the [[Cruciatus Curse]] demonstrated on a spider in his [[1994|fourth year]].&lt;ref name="GF14" /&gt;

When the Lestranges escaped from [[Azkaban]] in [[1996]], Neville did not discuss it, but he became very dedicated to his training in [[Dumbledore's Army]]. During the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], he was taunted about his parents by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], who also briefly subjected him to the Cruciatus Curse, but Neville remained defiant.&lt;ref name="OP35" /&gt; Neville would later carry on their legacy as a resistance fighter against Voldemort's regime at Hogwarts, and later in his brief career as an Auror.

====Augusta Longbottom====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Augusta Longbottom|Have you seen my grandson?|Harry Potter|He's fighting.|Naturally. Excuse me, I must go and assist him.|Augusta during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:AugustaLongbottomPS.png|234x234px|thumb|[[Augusta Longbottom]], his paternal grandmother|alt=]]

Neville was raised by his grandmother, Augusta Longbottom, after his parents were [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] to the point of insanity when he was an infant. This was pivotal in the development of his personality, as his grandmother often expressed her disappointment with her grandson's seeming lack of magical ability, and what she considered his inability to live up to his parents' skills. By Minerva McGonagall's claim, however, Augusta should be proud of the grandson she has, as opposed to the one she wants.

When Neville was a child, his grandmother, as well as some of his other [[Longbottom family|relatives]], feared that he might have been a [[Squib]].&lt;ref name="CS11" /&gt; However, when Neville showed great bravery and heroism during the [[Second Wizarding War]], his grandmother was clearly very proud of him. She came to Hogwarts during the final battle and ran off to assist him in fighting [[Death Eaters]].&lt;ref name="DH31" /&gt;

====Uncle Algie====
{{Quote|My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned —|Neville talking about Uncle Algie to his fellow Gryffindors|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Neville appeared to be fairly close to his great-uncle [[Algie Longbottom|Algie]], who tried to "scare" magic into him when he was younger; he once accidentally dropped Neville out of a window while reaching for a meringue, and when Neville bounced, his family was pleased to discover that he was not, in fact, a Squib. Algie later rewarded him with his pet toad [[Trevor]] for getting into Hogwarts. Algie and Neville appear to have shared an interest in [[Herbology]], as Algie gave Neville his very rare [[Mimbulus mimbletonia]] plant, which at one point was the password to the [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor Common Room]].
However, as Algie was willing to risk Neville's life to reveal his magic, such as pushing him into a lake and dangling him from a window, Algie more then likely cares for Neville's magic more than the boy himself.

====Hannah Abbott====
[[File:Abbot cropped.PNG|thumb|left|[[Hannah Abbott]], his future wife|alt=]]
Neville and [[Hannah Abbott]] were never shown as being more than classmates during school. Since Hannah was in [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]] and Neville in [[Gryffindor]], they probably did not spend too much time together, though it is possible that they became friends when they were both members of [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Sometime after leaving Hogwarts, Neville and Hannah married and moved into the [[Leaky Cauldron]], where she worked as the landlady and Neville as the Hogwarts Herbology teacher.

It is also possible that she and Neville became close during Herbology lessons, as those were shared by [[Gryffindor]] and [[Hufflepuff]] of their year. It stands to reason that, since Herbology was where Neville excelled, he may have been confident and even charming amongst the plant life, thus attracting Hannah's attention. Since Hannah lost her mother in her sixth year, it may also have been Neville's ability to sympathise with her grief that brought the two together, or simply Hannah felt attracted to Neville's heroism in the Battle of Hogwarts and when the war was over she kept contact with him, they fell in love and got married.

Hannah is eventually retrained as a Healer and applies to become the new matron of Hogwarts, a job held by [[Poppy Pomfrey]] during their years as students. It is possible that she applied in order to be closer to Neville. However, in the year 2020, Madame Pomfrey is seen to still be the matron, as she resets [[Albus Potter]]'s broken arm.

===Trevor===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Neville Longbottom|Sorry, but have you seen a toad at all? I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!|Harry Potter|He'll turn up.|Yes. Well, if you see him ...|Neville asking Harry Potter and Ron Weasley if they had seen Trevor on the Hogwarts Express|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Trevor.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Trevor]], his pet [[toad]]|alt=]]

Trevor was Neville's pet toad. He was given to Neville by his Uncle [[Algie Longbottom|Algie]] upon Neville's gaining admission to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Neville often lost Trevor, as he did the first time he rode the [[Hogwarts Express]] and [[Hermione Granger]] met [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] as she helped him search. In Neville's third year, Professor Snape made him test his Shrinking Solution on the toad; though Neville's dubious potion-making skills could have resulted in the toad's death, Trevor was successfully transformed into a tadpole, much to the [[Gryffindor]]s' delight.

At some point, Trevor escaped into the Hogwarts Lake. Both pet and owner felt a sense of relief.&lt;ref name="pottermore"&gt;{{PM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harry Potter===
{{Quote|Neville speaks most highly of you.|[[Augusta Longbottom]] regarding Neville's high regard of Harry|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:0138ootp harry.jpg|252x252px|thumb|left|[[Harry Potter]], his good friend and room-mate|alt=]]

Neville first met Harry Potter in [[1991]], while Neville was looking for his toad, [[Trevor]], on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. They became classmates and room-mates after they were both sorted into the [[Gryffindor]] house, and came to be good friends over the years. In [[1994]], Harry learned that Neville's parents were tortured into insanity by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]], and [[Rabastan Lestrange]]. Harry felt that Neville was far more deserving of pity than he, though he promised Dumbledore not to tell anyone what he knew, as it was Neville's decision whether or not to reveal his past to his friends.

In their fifth year, Neville became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], an organisation led by Harry to oppose [[Dolores Umbridge]] and learn practical [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|defensive magic]]. After the [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]] escaped from [[Azkaban]] that same year, Neville resolved to become stronger and try to honour his parents' reputations as excellent Aurors. True to his word, Neville fought alongside Harry at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and saved Harry's life from [[Walden Macnair]] when Macnair attempted to strangle Harry. When Harry was crying over the death of [[Sirius Black]], Neville did not question nor protest Harry's friendship with an alleged criminal and mass murder, instead consoling him for his godfather's demise.

In [[1996]], Harry refused to allow [[Romilda Vane]] to insult Neville and [[Luna Lovegood]], stating that they were his real friends, and the only ones who had fought alongside Ron, Ginny, Hermione, and himself at the Department of Mysteries. At the end of the year, Neville and Harry both fought in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and attended Dumbledore's [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]].

{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|You're worth twelve of Malfoy. The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.|Neville Longbottom|Thanks, Harry ... I think I'll go to bed.... D'you want the [[Chocolate Frog Card|card]], you collect them, don't you?|Harry consoling Neville in their [[first year]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

The next year, while Harry, Ron and Hermione left Hogwarts to search for Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es, Neville, along with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] and Luna Lovegood, led Dumbledore's Army in maintaining a steady level of opposition against [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]], two Death Eaters who had been appointed deputy Headmaster and Headmistress of Hogwarts under [[Severus Snape]]. Neville would later state that the hope Harry inspired in standing up to his enemies drove Neville to do the same. Neville and Harry fought together in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where Harry realised that Neville was one of his closest friends and one of the few people he would like to see once again before he dies in the forest and Neville showed his bravery and loyalty to Harry when he openly defied Voldemort and beheaded [[Nagini]], destroying Voldemort's last remaining Horcrux.

Neville and Harry remained in contact after the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]] and Harry made Neville the godfather of his son [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], showing their good friendship. Harry's children were later taught by Neville, who had been appointed [[Herbology]] professor at Hogwarts.

===Hermione Granger===
{{Dialogue a-b|Phineas Nigellus Black|Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!|Hermione Granger|Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!|Hermione Granger defending Neville and Luna to the [[portrait]] of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Hermione Granger OOTP profile.jpg|246x246px|thumb|[[Hermione Granger]], his friend|alt=]]

Neville met Hermione Granger on the [[Hogwarts Express]] when she helped him find [[Trevor]], his toad. During their years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], they became closer as Hermione encouraged him to stand up for himself when [[Draco Malfoy]] and his friends played pranks on him, or made jokes at his expense.

Because of his lack of confidence in classes, Neville frequently made mistakes, and Hermione usually came to his assistance, often whispering instructions in his ear. She also took note of how shaken Neville was by their [[fourth year]] lesson on the [[Unforgivable Curses]], shouting for [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Professor Moody]] to stop demonstrating the [[Cruciatus Curse]] and later asking Neville if it was all right. Because Hermione had "''always been so nice''", Neville plucked up the courage to ask her to the [[Yule Ball]] in [[1994]], though she had already accepted the offer of [[Viktor Krum]].&lt;ref name="GF23" /&gt;

Neville and Hermione became members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in [[1995]], during their fifth year at Hogwarts, and fought together at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], as well as in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] in [[1997]]. When the trio returned to Hogwarts in [[1998]] just before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], it was Neville who greeted them enthusiastically, and who first expressed a willingness to help them in any way possible and to fight the incoming [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] army.

After the [[Second Wizarding War]], the two best friends remained in contact throughout the years.

===Ron Weasley===
{{Quote|Blimey, Neville, there's a time and a place for getting a smart mouth!|Ron to Neville after Neville explains how he received injuries at the hands of [[Amycus Carrow|the]] [[Alecto Carrow|Carrows]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:0143ootp_ron.jpg|265x265px|thumb|left|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], his friend and room-mate|alt=]]

Neville met Ron Weasley on the [[Hogwarts Express]] at the start of their [[first year]]. As both were sorted into Gryffindor house, they became room-mates. Over time, Neville became good friends with Ron, who, like Hermione and Harry, encouraged Neville not to let the [[Slytherin]]s get to him.

Ron, Hermione, and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] all learned about Neville's parents during their [[fifth year]] at Hogwarts, and were shocked to learn that the good-natured, clumsy boy was carrying such a dark secret. Ron and Neville both became members of Dumbledore's Army in 1995, in order to oppose Professor Umbridge and learn to fight the [[Death Eaters]]. They fought alongside one another at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]. Neville greeted Ron, Harry, and Hermione enthusiastically when they returned to Hogwarts in [[1998]], and they all fought against Voldemort's forces in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. During the battle, Neville and Ron defeated [[Fenrir Greyback]] together protecting each other, after the battle they remained as best friends and they regularly see each other.

===Ginny Weasley===
[[File:Ginny Weasley OOTP promo.jpeg|249x249px|thumb|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], a good friend and his [[Yule Ball]] date|alt=]]

After asking Hermione to the Yule Ball in his fourth year and being turned down because she had already agreed to attend with [[Viktor Krum]], Neville asked Ginny Weasley. She agreed to go with him as a friend, being too young to attend otherwise.&lt;ref name="GF23" /&gt;

The two continued to be friendly afterwards, and Ginny, like Harry, Hermione and Ron, encouraged Neville to be more confident. She and [[Luna Lovegood]] were co-leaders of the re-formed [[Dumbledore's Army]] along with Neville when Snape and the [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow|Carrows]] controlled Hogwarts.&lt;ref name="DH29" /&gt; Ginny and Neville also fought at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] (where they blew up together the covered bridge).

After the war, Ginny and Neville remained in contact, and they remained closest friends, with Ginny naming Neville godfather to her son [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]] and being on friendly terms with her other son, [[James Potter II|James Sirius]].

===Luna Lovegood===
{{Dialogue a-b-c|Luna Lovegood|And I don't know who you are.|Neville|I'm nobody.|Ginny Weasley|No, you're not. Neville Longbottom — Luna Lovegood...|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] introduces Neville and Luna|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:Luna HPHBP.jpg|244x244px|thumb|left|[[Luna Lovegood]], a good friend|alt=]]
Neville and Luna, a [[Ravenclaw]] student, first met on the [[Hogwarts Express]], in [[1995]]. Neville found Luna a bit "''odd''", as she believed in the existence of strange, mythical creatures, had a tendency to read magazines upside down, and wore earrings that appeared to be made of radishes. Luna, like Harry and Neville, had the ability to see [[Thestral]]s, as they had all seen someone die.

Spacey as Luna seemed, she fought alongside Neville at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. At some point they became very close friends. During Neville's last year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], he, Luna and Ginny, re-formed and co-led [[Dumbledore's Army]] in order to oppose the [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow|Carrows]]. Neville seems to have a place in his heart for Luna, they also remained close friends in later life. It seemed that Luna was always glad when Neville, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and Harry were close by, proved when the trio visited Luna's father [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] and seeing Luna's room with their painting on her bedroom ceiling connected with gold letters spelling "''friends''".

===Draco Malfoy===
{{Quote|Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than [[Ronald Weasley|Weasley]], and that's saying something.|Draco Malfoy's opinion of Neville|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Draco Malfoy Promo HPB.jpg|259x259px|thumb|[[Draco Malfoy]], his school bully|alt=]]
Initially shy and clumsy, Neville regularly found himself on the receiving end of insults from Draco and his [[Draco Malfoy's gang|gang]], and was often the butt of their jokes and pranks — a fact which served only to make Neville clumsier and less confident. When encouraged by Hermione, Ron, and Harry to stand up for himself, Neville replied with "''how I can barely stand at all''" but, despite this previous mind set Neville grew to be someone who was much more difficult to bully by his later years at Hogwarts.

He started resisting against not only the Slytherin students, but also [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]] and [[Severus Snape]]. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Neville proved to have made an impressive and complete turn around from his earlier years of crumbling under Draco's bullying, when he openly defied [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and beheaded [[Nagini]], effectively destroying Voldemort's final [[Horcrux]].

===Dumbledore's Army===
{{Quote|I liked the D.A.! I learned ''loads'' with you!|Neville to [[Harry Potter]] on D.A. meetings|Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince}}
[[File:Dumbledore's_Army.jpg|245x245px|thumb|left|[[Dumbledore's Army]], his friends and allies|alt=]]
Dumbledore's Army was an organisation led by Harry Potter that sought not only to undermine the dictatorial authority of [[Dolores Umbridge]], but to offer students a means of learning the practical defensive magic Umbridge denied them in their actual [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class. Neville became a member at the time of its formation in 1995, and this marked something of a turning point both in terms Neville's relationships with other Hogwarts students, and in terms of his magical ability beyond [[Herbology]]. As the D.A.'s practice progressed throughout the course of the year, Neville showed marked improvement in his ability to [[Disarming Charm|disarm]] and [[Stunning Spell|stun]], as well as perform the [[Impediment Jinx]] and [[Reductor Curse]], among others.

When several [[Death Eaters]] [[Azkaban escapes|escaped]] from [[Azkaban]] in early 1996, all of the D.A. pushed themselves to improve their duelling abilities, but none more than Neville, as three of the escapees had taken part in torturing his parents into insanity.

While training with the D.A.equipped Neville to face the [[Death Eaters]] in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], the sense of camaraderie Neville enjoyed with them made him one of only three members (along with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] and [[Luna Lovegood]]) to answer Ron and Hermione's call leading up to the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]].

Neville, Ginny and Luna co-led the DA in 1997, when it was re-formed to oppose the reign of Severus Snape, Alecto Carrow, and Amycus Carrow at Hogwarts. Most of the former members reunited and spent ample time hiding in the [[Room of Requirement]], awaiting the return of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They were quick to mobilise against the invading Death Eaters, with Neville at their lead, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione were searching for [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem]]. While Fred Weasley, Lavender Brown and Colin Creevey were tragically killed, Neville fought valiantly and eventually beheaded [[Nagini]] on Harry's orders, destroyed Voldemort's final remaining [[Horcrux]].

===Bellatrix Lestrange===
{{Dialogue a-b|Bellatrix|Longbottom? Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy....|Neville|I DOE YOU HAB!|Bellatrix taunting Neville during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Bellatrix-promo-bellatrix-lestrange-28967562-470-627.jpg|233x233px|thumb|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]], a hated enemy and the witch who helped torture his parents into insanity|alt=]]
Bellatrix Lestrange led fellow [[Death Eaters]]; [[Rodolphus Lestrange]], [[Rabastan Lestrange]], and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] in the torture Neville's parents by means of the [[Cruciatus Curse]], leaving them permanently incapacitated in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]]. When Bellatrix [[Azkaban escapes|escaped]] from [[Azkaban]] prison in January [[1996]], Neville was heavily affected.

His performance in [[Dumbledore's Army]] increased to the point where he managed to master the [[Shield Charm]] before everyone but [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]]. When he [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|went to the Ministry of Magic]] later that year, Bellatrix taunted him about his parents, but Neville fought back, much to Bellatrix's surprise. Neville also saw Bellatrix murder [[Sirius Black]], and expressed his condolences to Harry. Neville met Bellatrix again in [[1998]], during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where she was eventually killed in a duel by [[Molly Weasley]].

===Severus Snape===
{{Quote|Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn't you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one rat spleen was needed? Didn't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?|Snape tormenting Neville|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Severus Snape Profile.jpg|247x247px|thumb|left|[[Severus Snape]], his professor and [[Boggart]]|alt=]]
During his years at school, Neville was terrified of Professor Severus Snape, and the poor boy managed to earn the [[Potions Master]]'s ire in almost every lesson. Snape regularly and unnecessarily targeted Neville with verbal taunts, threats, sarcasm, and malice, which put an extremely nervous Neville even more on edge. Snape went so far as to feed a few drops of Neville's [[Shrinking Solution]] to Neville's pet, [[Trevor]], so as to humiliate him for doing badly on the potion and almost kill Neville's toad. Thanks to Hermione, Neville was able to fix his potion so that his toad wasn't harmed.

Neville admitted in [[1993]] that Snape scared him more than anything else in the world, and was the form his [[boggart]] took. When [[Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] asked the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class what frightened them the most, Neville at first mumbled inaudibly; when Professor Lupin asked Neville to say it clearly, Neville (after wildly looking around) whispered "''Professor Snape''." Nearly everyone laughed at that, and then Professor Lupin replied thoughtfully, "''Professor Snape''."&lt;ref name="PA7" /&gt;

When he sat his [[Potions (class)|Potions]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in [[1996]], Harry noted that Neville looked happier than usual without Snape around. Neville also co-led the second [[Dumbledore's Army]] and wrote slogans on the walls, in order to oppose Snape and the Carrows. Snape was killed by Nagini during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Though Neville was present when Harry informed Voldemort of Snape's true allegiance, it is unknown how Neville reacted. It is possible Snape hated Neville so much because if Voldemort had chosen to go after him rather than Harry, Lily would still be alive.

===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Quote|There are all kinds of courage. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr Neville Longbottom.|Albus Dumbledore rewarding Neville's bravery|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Albus Dumbledore POA promo.jpg|237x237px|thumb|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his headmaster|alt=]]
Neville thought Albus Dumbledore was the greatest [[Wizardkind|wizard]] of all time. He met Dumbledore in [[1991]], when he was the headmaster of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. At the end of Neville's first year, Dumbledore awarded [[Gryffindor]] the ten points they needed to win the House cup because Neville had the courage to try and stop [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] from leaving the Gryffindor tower after hours. Dumbledore also knew about Neville's parents, and told Harry not to say anything, leaving Neville the right to choose when he revealed his past to his friends.

Dumbledore and Neville also fought together at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], and the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], where Dumbledore was killed by Severus Snape. Neville was devastated by his death. Neville despised professor [[Dolores Umbridge]], the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]-appointed [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor for the [[1995–1996 school year]]. Like nearly everyone else at Hogwarts, with the possible exception of some of the [[Slytherin]] students and [[Argus Filch]], Neville hated Umbridge for her sadistic punishments and attempts to control the school. He became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] partially in order to oppose her. Umbridge left the school in 1996 after paying the price for verbally assaulting a herd of centaurs and attempting to flee; she was discovered by Peeves, who led the students in chasing her away from the school.

[[Death Eaters]] [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]] were appointed professors at Hogwarts in [[1997]], after Dumbledore's [[death]]. Amycus taught Defence Against the Dark Arts, which he changed to the [[Dark Arts]], and Alecto taught [[Muggle Studies]] with an obvious anti-Muggle slant. Amycus and Alecto liked to punish the students with the use of torture, and ordered students to practise the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on other students who had been detained. Neville helped re-form Dumbledore's Army, along with Ginny and Luna, and maintained a steady opposition against the Carrows throughout the course of the year. In an attempt to control Neville, Ministry Auror John Dawlish was sent to take Neville's grandmother hostage; unfortunately for Dawlish, the tenacious Augusta Longbottom fought back, apparently putting Dawlish in St Mungo's and going on the run. As the Carrows no longer had hope of finding any real leverage to use against Neville, and had no reason not to simply kill him, Neville went into hiding in the Room of Requirement, where he was soon joined by a number of other Gryffindor, [[Hufflepuff]] and [[Ravenclaw]] students who saw fit to do the same.

===Hogwarts staff===
{{Quote|It's high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she's got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what happened at the Ministry.|Minerva praising Neville's abilities|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:600full-harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|246x246px|thumb|left|[[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], his Head of House and professor|alt=]]
Minerva McGonagall was Neville's Head of [[Gryffindor|House]] and Transfiguration professor during his years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She often scolded Neville for his clumsiness and incompetence, though it was more likely his lack of confidence that frustrated her. McGonagall knew that Neville was capable of more than he seemed and saw that he was actually brave, and thus encouraged him to work to his potential. She was also a friend of Neville's [[Augusta Longbottom|grandmother]], and had known his parents in their days as Aurors. Neville and McGonagall both fought in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and both survived the war. Years after the war, Neville was given the position of Herbology professor at Hogwarts, although it is unknown if McGonagall was still teaching there.

[[File:PSprout.png|276x276px|thumb|[[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]], his Herbology professor|alt=]]
Professor Sprout was Neville's [[Herbology]] professor, and as Neville proved to be quite adept at Herbology, possibly the best in the year, she was undoubtedly the Professor he got along with best. At one point, Sprout even spoke of Neville's strength in the subject to [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], while he was disguised as [[Alastor Moody|Professor Moody]]. Neville helped Sprout use [[Devil's Snare]], [[Mandrake]]s, [[Venomous Tentacula]], and [[Snargaluff]] pods to attack the [[Death Eaters]] during the Battle of Hogwarts, and they both survived the war. It is likely that Sprout had retired by the time Neville was appointed the new Herbology Professor, though they may have taught the class together.

===Bartemius Crouch Junior===
{{Quote|It's all right, sonny. Why don't you come up to my office? Come on... we can have a cup of [[tea]]....|Barty Crouch (as [[Alastor Moody]]) pretending to comfort Neville after showing him the [[Cruciatus Curse]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Barty Crouch Jnr cropped.jpg|253x253px|thumb|left|[[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Bartemius Crouch Jnr]], who helped torture his parents into insanity|alt=]]
Barty Crouch Junior was also involved in the torture of Neville's parents by means of the [[Cruciatus Curse]].&lt;ref name="GOF30" /&gt; During Neville's [[fourth year]], Barty impersonated [[Alastor Moody]] and served as Neville's [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] Professor.&lt;ref name="GOF35"&gt;{{GOF|B|35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his first lesson with the fourth years, Barty (as Moody) took notice of Neville's name on the class register. He then demonstrated the three [[Unforgivable Curses]] on [[Bartemius Crouch Junior's spiders|spiders]], including the Cruciatus Curse, which left Neville deeply shaken.&lt;ref name="GOF14"&gt;{{GOF|B|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Moody" afterwards had tea with Neville and gave him a [[Magical Mediterranean Water-Plants and Their Properties|book]] about [[Herbology]], seemingly out of comfort and support,&lt;ref name="GOF14" /&gt; although it was later revealed that he had only done so to give Harry a clue about the [[Triwizard Tournament]]'s second task.&lt;ref name="GOF35" /&gt; It is unknown how Neville reacted upon learning the truth about his D.A.D.A. teacher. Barty Crouch was given the [[Dementor's Kiss]] in [[1995]] after having been exposed, losing his [[soul]].&lt;ref name="GOF36"&gt;{{GOF|B|36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord Voldemort===
{{Dialogue a-b|Lord Voldemort|You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.|Neville|I'll join you when hell freezes over! Dumbledore's Army!|Voldemort and Neville at the Battle of Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Tom Riddle DHF2.jpg|244x244px|thumb|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], an enemy|alt=]]
Neville was one of the two boys possibly referred to in [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|the prophecy]] as being destined to bring about Voldemort's end. However, Voldemort chose to target the [[Potter family|Potters]] based on the simple concept that Harry was a half-blood like himself, thus marking Harry, and not Neville, as his equal. After Lord Voldemort's first defeat, four fanatically loyal [[Death Eaters]] tortured Neville's parents, [[Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Alice Longbottom]], to the point of insanity, using the [[Cruciatus Curse]], in an attempt to force Voldemort's whereabouts out of them; this fact initially haunted Neville, but eventually spurred him to rise to his full potential.

After honing his skills and steadily acquiring self-confidence through training with [[Dumbledore's Army]], Neville fought against Voldemort's Death Eaters countless times during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Near the end of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Neville actually attempted to charge directly at Voldemort, presumably aiming to slay [[Nagini]], as Harry had told him she had to die at all costs. Voldemort offered Neville the chance to join him, commending his "''spirit and bravery'';" Neville declined, and instead, drew the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] from the [[Sorting Hat]] and succeeded in beheading Nagini. As Nagini had been Voldemort's last remaining Horcrux, Neville's incredible display of bravery allowed Harry to defeat Voldemort once and for all.

In addition to this, Neville also indirectly fulfilled his role in the prophecy by destroying Voldemort's last remaining Horcrux as it was this act which rendered Voldemort mortal and allowed Harry to finally defeat Voldemort. Although Voldemort chose to mark Harry as his target based on the prophecy, Neville proved by standing up to him and destroying his final Horcrux that he was capable of being the other boy to meet the prophecy's requirements. It is unknown whether Voldemort recognised Neville as the other boy which the prophecy referred to and it is also unknown if Neville ever learnt this himself after Voldemort's final defeat.

==Etymology==
*Neville is an English name originally derived from Norman French for "new town".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindthename.com/name/neville Behind the Name: Neville]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the surname of a noble and a powerful warrior lineage family prominent in England in the medieval period, as well as the given name of a Prime Minister of Britain, [[Wikipedia:Neville Chamberlain|Neville Chamberlain]], whose role in history is controversial. Neville Chamberlain is infamous for his policy of appeasing dictator Adolf Hitler just prior to World War II, which is ironic, considering that Neville Longbottom never faltered in his defiance of Lord Voldemort.
*Longbottom is the name of one of the Hobbits' villages at the [[Wikipedia:Shire|Shire]], known for its best pipe-weed.
*Longbottom is a family name around Bristol, where JK Rowling spent part of her childhood.

==Behind the scenes==

[[File:NevilleLEGO2.jpg|180px|thumb|Neville as a LEGO mini-figure (second edition)]]

[[File:Neville_Longbottom_holding_book_pop_vinyl.png|180px|thumb|Neville Longbottom holding [[The Monster Book of Monsters]] as a [[POP! Vinyl]]]]
*Neville's initial lack of magical power could be deemed the result of his grandmother's overbearing presence as he acknowledges that she is constantly telling both him and others that he is not as talented as his parents and Dumbledore states that misery and lack of confidence can sap a wizard of his or her powers.
*On [[18 February]], Neville Longbottom's check-out of {{QTA}} from the [[Hogwarts Library]] ends.
*Neville never took [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T. level]] [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], since he only earned an [[Acceptable]]. However, like Harry and Ron, he was still recruited by [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] into the [[Auror]] department after the battle to help track down any remaining [[Death Eaters]].&lt;ref name="PotterCast" /&gt; It is likely that Kingsley made the requirements less advanced, since Harry and Ron also did not complete their N.E.W.T.s, but displayed outstanding bravery and [[duelling]] skills in the [[Second Wizarding War]].
*It is possible [[Severus Snape]]'s hatred for Neville was due to him being the second boy in the prophecy, which means if Voldemort had chosen to go after Neville rather than Harry, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily]] would still be alive.
*There is a feature named "Neville Longbottom, a true Gryffindor" on {{PM}}.
*Rowling has revealed that the original last name for Neville's character was "Puff."&lt;ref name="LEX" /&gt;
[[File:NevilleLongbottomTCG.png|180px|thumb|"[[Neville Longbottom (Trading Card)|Neville Longbottom]]" [[Harry Potter Trading Card Game|Trading Card]] from the {{TCG|QC}} depicting Neville and [[Trevor]]]]
*In [[J. K. Rowling]]'s sketches of the five [[Gryffindor]] boys in [[Harry Potter]]'s year, Neville is shown as being the shortest,&lt;ref name="LEX"&gt;[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/neville.html Harry Potter Lexicon: Neville Longbottom]&lt;/ref&gt; but in the films, Neville is the tallest, aside from [[Dean Thomas]]. Rowling also described Neville as blond,&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; but this was never printed in the novels, and in the films, he has brown hair.
**Furthermore, it's unknown if his appearance changed as he matured over the years, but it should be noted that the film Neville grew from a short, chubby boy into a lean young man taller than even Harry.
*Neville is a playable character in {{DH|GA2}}. In the game, Neville deflects a curse sent from [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] using the [[Sword of Gryffindor]], causing it to hit [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] in the leg. This could have been to allow Neville payback towards Bellatrix for torturing his parents.

===In films===
*Neville is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[Matthew Lewis]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]'' and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations.
**Neville is portrayed to be left-handed. He is seen writing with this hand in a publicity photo for {{OOTP}} and he also holds the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] in his left hand in publicity photos for {{DH|F2}}. He is seen holding his [[Neville Longbottom's wands|wand]] in his left hand several times in the film series.
**Since Matthew Lewis is from Leeds, West Yorkshire, he portrays Neville with a Yorkshire accent.
**In a game of Mastermind, Matthew Lewis commented that he has been wearing a fat suit for most the films but in ''Deathly Hallows'', he isn't going to be wearing it any longer (though the Neville character has been noticeably slimmer from the fourth film onward (except for ''Order of the Phoenix'') which most likely is attributed to Neville's transition from shy and clumsy to a more hands-on supporting leader-like figure.)
**Matthew Lewis' favourite line is "why is it always me?" from the ''Chamber of Secrets''.
**Matthew Lewis had to wear fake teeth for the fourth film.
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Neville is shown to be quite good at dancing, being one of the very last to leave the ball. However, in the novel, he is shown to be quite bad at dancing, stepping on Ginny's toes numerous times.
*Also in the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', it is Neville who gives Harry the Gillyweed before the Second Task, rather than [[Dobby]], as he does in the book.
*Neville seemed to get a bit more mature and determined in the ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' film, such as being critical of Harry Potter for rigging the [[Triwizard Tournament]], but after Harry passed the First Task without either dying or being hurt, Neville advised him to use Gillyweed to breathe underwater for the Second Task. However, those changes are not noted in the book.
*The short film {{QH}} includes a reference to Neville's grandfather playing a trick on his grandmother in 1947. The canonicity of the mini-episode is uncertain.
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, it is [[Lucius Malfoy]] who breaks the prophecy, not Neville.
*In {{DH|F2}}:
**There is a duel between Neville and [[Scabior]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/exclusive-matthew-lewis-talks-verdict-confirms-new-deathly-hallows-ii-battle-scene-79819 "Exclusive: Matthew Lewis talks Verdict, confirms new Deathly Hallows: II battle scene"] on SnitchSeeker.com&lt;/ref&gt;
**Neville confesses to Harry and Ginny during the battle that he is in love with [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]]. However, [[Matthew Lewis]] has said that this is merely a "summer fling" before Neville marries [[Hannah Abbott]] and Luna marries [[Rolf Scamander]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/audio-harry-potter-cast-and-crew-at-deathly-hallows-part-2-nyc-press-conference-82597/ "Audio: Harry Potter cast &amp; crew at Deathly Hallows: Part 2 NYC press conference"] on SnitchSeeker.com&lt;/ref&gt;
**Neville is not burned by Voldemort, he instead makes a speech that despite Harry's 'death,' he still exists in their hearts, and that he didn't die for nothing. He even taunts Voldemort, saying that he will die in vain, (though Voldemort simply laughs at him), he pulls out the sword and Harry reveals himself to be alive. As the battle restarts, Voldemort, in his rage, actually [[Stunning Spell|stuns]] Neville before he can give Harry the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] but he recovers and beheads [[Nagini]].
