'''Argus Filch''' was a [[Squib]] and the [[Hogwarts Caretaker|caretaker]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] since around [[1973]]. Filch usually wandered around the school corridors with his cat [[Mrs Norris]], trying to catch students breaking the school rules and complaining about [[Peeves]] the [[Poltergeist]].

In [[1992]], after Mrs Norris was [[Petrification|petrified]] by [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]], Filch was furious; however, his cat was healed by the end of the year. In [[1995]], when [[Dolores Umbridge]] became High Inquisitor at Hogwarts, Filch gladly supported her. The next year, he was responsible for recognising [[Dark Arts|Dark]] objects that were brought into Hogwarts.

Filch helped the students evacuate during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]] and participated in the battle himself. He kept his job of caretaker after the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Filch was also the only one of the Hogwarts staff to stay at [[Hogwarts Castle]] during the summer holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-swns-alfie.htm South West News Service interview with JKR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Little is known about Filch's early life. He was born to at least one [[wizardkind|wizard]] parent sometime before [[1951]],&lt;ref name="birth" /&gt; presumably somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]]. Despite his magical parentage, Filch was a [[Squib]], meaning he could not perform [[magic]].&lt;ref name="CS9" /&gt;

===Career at Hogwarts===
====Early years====
{{Quote|Haven't you been complaining about [[Peeves]] for a quarter of a century?|[[Minerva McGonagall]], in 1998, relays for how long Filch has been working at Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
In around [[1968]],&lt;ref name="Bellatrix"&gt;In {{HM}}, it is revealed that Filch had known [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] during her time as a student.&lt;/ref&gt; Filch joined the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]],&lt;ref name="DH30" /&gt; succeeding [[Apollyon Pringle]] as [[Hogwarts Caretaker|Caretaker]].&lt;ref name="GF31"&gt;{{GOF|B|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filch waged a constant war against the students and [[Peeves]], the school's resident [[poltergeist]].&lt;ref name="PS8"&gt;{{PS|B|8}} &lt;/ref&gt; He disliked the students and constantly hassled them over the littlest infraction and took delight in the doling out of detention-worthy write-ups.&lt;ref name="CS8"&gt;{{COS|B|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[1970s]], Filch had already filled at least one thousand and fifty-six boxes with punishment records.&lt;ref name="HBP24"&gt;{{HBP|B|24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filch frequently patrolled the hallways at night-time, hunting down students wandering out of bed and looking for excuses to give them [[Discipline at Hogwarts#Detention|detentions]].&lt;ref name="PS9"&gt;{{PS|B|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his years as Caretaker, Filch learned all about the Castle's [[Hogwarts secret passages|secret passageways and hidden doors]] better than anyone but the [[Fred and George Weasley|Weasley twins]] and the [[Marauders]].&lt;ref name="PS8" /&gt;

Filch lived in a dingy and windowless [[Room 234-00|office]] containing filing cabinets with detailed records of all the students Filch had disciplined. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch's desk. He always begged Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.&lt;ref name="CS8" /&gt;

During the 1970s, Filch did many write-ups of [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and [[Sirius Black]], occasionally accompanied by the names of [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Peter Pettigrew]].&lt;ref name="HBP24" /&gt; In the 1977-1978 school year, Filch, probably on a tip-off from [[Severus Snape]], whose obsession it had become to expose his arch-rival, [[James Potter I|James Potter]] in wrongdoing, confiscated the [[Marauder's Map]] after the Marauders over-reached themselves and were cornered.&lt;ref name="PottermoreMarauder'sMap"&gt;{{WW|the-marauders-map}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filch stored the map in a cabinet marked "''Confiscated and Highly Dangerous''".&lt;ref name="PA10"&gt;{{POA|B|10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Filch was a [[Squib]] and could not make the map work properly,&lt;ref name="PA10" /&gt; he did know that it was called the Marauder's Map.&lt;ref name="HM5CH4"/&gt;

====1984–1985 school year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a-b|[[Argus Filch]]|[[Jacob's sibling|You]] don't want to invite me to any party. You probably just want to trick me by filling my invitation with [[Stink Pellets]]...|Jacob's sibling|No!|By filling my drink with [[Bulbadox powder]]?|No!|By training a [[Red Cap]] to sit inside the cake until I try to take a slice, at which point it hops out and bludgeons my skull?|No!|Argus' sceptical personality against Jacob's sibling party invitation|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}

In the [[1984–1985 school year]], Filch and Mrs Norris found the [[cursed ice]]. Suspecting it was linked to the [[Cursed Vaults]], he was about to report to Dumbledore, but spotted Professor [[Severus Snape]] first and told him instead. He brought the Professor to the corridor where he found the ice.&lt;ref name="HM16"&gt;{{HM|1|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this school year, Jacob's sibling tried to invite him to Hagrid's birthday party, which was pretty successful and he attended the party, although Professor McGonagall considered it a miracle if he agreed to celebrate anything whatsoever.&lt;ref name="HM1PP"&gt;{{HM|1|Party Planner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1986–1987 school year====
During the [[1986–1987 school year]], he confiscated [[Jacob's notebooks]] in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] from [[Jacob's sibling]] on Snape's orders to confiscate all items related to the [[Cursed Vaults]].&lt;ref name="HM33"&gt;{{HM|3|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Jacob's sibling and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] conspired to scare Filch from his office to retrieve the notebook. They brought either a [[Nose-Biting Teacup]] or [[Fanged Frisbee]] from [[Zonko's Joke Shop]], and after Jacob's sibling placed the prank device inside his office after hiding themselves with the [[Shrinking Charm]], Filch opened the box containing the prank device which forced him and Mrs Norris to retreat, allowing them to read and retrieve the notebooks.&lt;ref name="HM34"&gt;{{HM|3|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this school year, he also caught Jacob's sibling with [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] in the [[Potions Classroom]]. After insulting Sir Nicholas and threatening to report them, Sir Nicholas denounced Filch as a low-class bully and that he was supervising said student. After this, he was forced to award them ten [[house points]], much to his and Mrs Norris's displeasure.&lt;ref name="HM3Nick"&gt;{{HM|3|Nearly Headless Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1988–1989 school year====
During the [[1988–1989 school year]], the [[Marauder's Map]] was stolen from his office by a thief that he suspected to be [[Peeves]].&lt;ref name="HM5CH4"/&gt; The Map was later brought back to Filch's office and kept there until [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] 'nicked' it during their first year, [[1989–1990 school year]], at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] after being hauled to his office for letting off a [[Dungbomb]] in a corridor.&lt;ref name="PA10"/&gt;

[[File:PinceFilchVDB.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]] and Mr Filch attending the [[Valentine's Day Ball]]]]
When [[Valentine's Day]] was around the corner, [[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]], who was entrusted by [[Albus Dumbledore]] to organise the [[Valentine's Day Ball]], talked to Filch about the arrangements. He was later approached by [[Jacob's sibling]] who was concerned about Pince's plan for the Ball and told him Pince loved gorgeous settings such as such as flowers, music and refreshments instead. During their next meeting about the Ball, Filch brought it up and Pince was eventually convinced. On [[14 February]] [[1989]], Filch attended the Valentine's Day Ball with Pince.&lt;ref name="VDB"/&gt;

====1989–1990 school year====
[[File:Snape, Filch and Madam Pince HM622.png|250px|thumb|left|Filch standing with Madam Pince and Severus Snape in the Potions classroom]]
During the [[1989–1990 school year]], Filch was speaking to Snape and Madam Pince in the [[Potions Classroom]] when he was introduced to [[Brazil]]ian [[Student exchange programme|exchange student]] [[Alanza Alves]] by [[Jacob's sibling]]. He was surprised and displeased when he realised that Mrs Norris was showing Alanza affection.&lt;ref name="HM622"&gt;{{HM|6|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later during this school year, he caught Jacob's sibling and their [[Circle of Khanna|friends]] on the [[Training Grounds]] at night after hours, and took them to the [[Headmaster's office]] for [[Discipline at Hogwarts|punishment]].&lt;ref name="HM629"&gt;{{HM|6|29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990–1991 school year====
[[File:Pince hiccoughing after eating Hiccough Sweets HM722.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Madam Pince hiccoughing after eating Hiccough Sweets]]
During the [[1990–1991 school year]], Filch was tricked into giving [[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]] [[Hiccough Sweet]]s, causing her to leave the [[Hogwarts Library|library]]'s [[Restricted Section]] unattended.&lt;ref name="HM722"&gt;{{HM|7|22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this school year, he tasked Jacob's sibling with finding a missing Mrs Norris. She had got trapped in the roots of the [[Hogwarts Whomping Willow]] where she was found by [[Fang]], and was returnef to Filch promptly. Filch thanked the student for their help, despite his usually grouchy nature.&lt;ref name="HM746A"&gt;{{HM|7|46|Missing Mrs Norris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1991–1992 school year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Peeves|STUDENTS OUT OF BED! STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!|Argus Filch|Which way did they go, Peeves? Quick, tell me.|Say 'please'.|Filch tries to catch the trio and Neville Longbottom breaking rules|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Filch Forbidden Corridor.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Filch searching the third floor corridor for students out of bed]]

By [[1991]], Filch had [[Mrs Norris]], his cat, following [[Rubeus Hagrid]] every time he went up into the Castle.&lt;ref name="PS8"/&gt;

During the Start-of-Term Feast in the evening of 1 September, Filch stood by the double doors leading to the [[Great Hall]] as Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] gave his start-of-term notices.&lt;ref name="PSf12"&gt;{{PS|F}} - Chapter 12 (''Sorting Hat'')&lt;/ref&gt;

On their very first morning at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], [[2 September]], [[1991]], [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley]] managed to get on Filch's wrong side. Filch found them trying to force their way through the door of the [[Third-floor corridor|out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor]]. Despite their truthful claims that they were lost, Filch did not believe them and threatened to lock them in the [[dungeons]]. They were saved by [[Quirinus Quirrell]], who vouched for them while passing by.&lt;ref name="PS8" /&gt;

On [[12 September]], [[Draco Malfoy]] challenged Harry Potter to a [[Duelling|duel]] in the [[Trophy Room]] at midnight. Malfoy, however, never showed up and instead tipped Filch that there would be students out of bed in the Trophy Room. Filch almost caught Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Neville Longbottom]], but they successfully managed to hide in the Forbidden Corridor as Peeves refused to share any information with Filch.&lt;ref name="PS9" /&gt;

On 8 November, Filch helped [[Severus Snape]] to apply bandages in order to dress the wounds on his leg after the Potions Master had been bitten by [[Fluffy]].&lt;ref name="PS11"&gt;{{PS|B|11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas, [[Albus Dumbledore]] gave Harry Potter his father's [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]]. Harry used it that night to sneak into the [[Restricted Section]] and research about [[Nicolas Flamel]], which he knew was related to the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. After he opened [[Shrieking book|a book]] that screamed, Filch arrived on the scene almost immediately but was unable to see Harry. Filch warned Snape at once and Harry, while trying to avoid them, hid in an [[Disused classroom|unused classroom]] and stumbled into the [[Mirror of Erised]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="PS12" /&gt;

[[File:FilchtoForbiddenForest.jpg|250px|thumb|Filch takes Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, and Draco Malfoy to their detention in the Forbidden Forest]]

After Harry Potter and Hermione Granger had carried [[Norberta|Norbert]] to the [[Astronomy Tower]], so that [[Charles Weasley]]'s colleagues could take the dragon to [[Romania]], Filch caught the pair roaming the [[Astronomy Corridor]] on their way back to [[Gryffindor Tower]] in the early hours of [[10 May]], [[1992]].&lt;ref name="PS14"&gt;{{PS|B|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caretaker took them to [[Minerva McGonagall]]'s [[Minerva McGonagall's Office|office]], where they were joined by Neville Longbottom and Draco Malfoy who had also been caught out of bed. They were given detention in the [[Forbidden Forest]], along with deductions of fifty [[house points]] each.&lt;ref name="PS15"&gt;{{PS|B|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[26 May]], Filch brought the four students to [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who was assigned to lead them into the Forbidden Forest. Filch tried to frighten them, by telling that many dangerous creatures lived there. In contrast to this warning, Hagrid remained his jovial self and tried to assure all of them that they were safe.&lt;ref name="PS15" /&gt;

====1992–1993 school year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Argus Filch|What's going on here? What's going on? My cat! My cat! What's happened to Mrs Norris? ''You''! You! You've murdered my cat! You've killed her! I'll kill you! I'll —|Albus Dumbledore| ''Argus!'' Come with me, Argus. You, too, Mr Potter, Mr Weasley, Miss Granger.|Argus Filch accuses [[Harry Potter]] of having killed Mrs Norris|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:ArgusFilch WithMrsNorrisCatchingHarryAndRon.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Filch catching Harry Potter and Ron Weasley after they crash a car into the Whomping Willow]]

At the beginning of the 1992-1993 school year, Harry Potter and [[Ronald Weasley]] arrived at school, not via the [[Hogwarts Express]], but in [[Arthur Weasley]]'s [[Flying Ford Anglia]]; [[Minerva McGonagall]], their [[Head of House]], gave them different punishments. Ron had to help Filch polish the silvers at the Trophy Room without using magic for his detention.&lt;ref name="CS7"&gt;{{COS|B|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron spent the evening of 5 September, 1992 with Filch, and kept burping up slugs all over Tom Riddle's [[Special Award for Services to the School]].&lt;ref name="CS13"&gt;{{COS|B|13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the school year, Filch tried to improve his status as a [[Squib]] using a [[Kwikspell]] course. Of course, as Filch had no inherent magical powers, this was of little use. After the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]'s practice on 24 October, Mrs Norris saw Harry Potter who was covered in soil and dirt. Soon, Filch discovered Harry and took him to his office; however, before he could punish Harry, Filch heard a noise and realised that [[Peeves]] had damaged a very valuable [[Vanishing Cabinet]]. He left Harry and ran to find Peeves, excited that he might finally be able to pursuade Dumbledore to kick Peeves out of Hogwarts. However, when he returned to his office, he learned that Harry had read his letter about Kwikspell courses. Filch was furious and kicked Harry out off his office, trying to convince him that the letter was not his, and ordering him not to tell anyone.&lt;ref name="CS8" /&gt;

[[File:Writting on the wall.jpg|250px|thumb|Filch and [[Harry Potter]] standing under a message written on the corridor walls and staring at a petrified Mrs Norris (not pictured)]]

During the school year, a mysterious, dangerous monster roamed around the Castle and tried to attack muggle-born students. The first individual to be attacked was Mrs Norris, Filch's cat, whom he had a very close relationship with. The cat was found [[Petrification|petrified]] under a message written on the wall saying that "''THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE''", causing Filch tremendous stress and concern: he believed that Harry Potter was the one who petrified her, as he knew that Filch was a Squib. [[Severus Snape]] agreed with Filch, not because he had the same opinion, but because he wanted Harry to be punished. However, Dumbledore managed to convince Filch that Harry was not responsible, as he could not have performed such [[Dark Arts|Dark magic]], being twelve years old at the time.&lt;ref name="CS9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CS8" /&gt;

After the attack, Filch frequently paced the corridor in which it had taken place, as though hoping for the attacker to return. He even put a chair against the wall to keep guard there. On occasion, he fruitlessly scrubbed the message with [[Mrs Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover]], but to no effect. During this time, he became more vicious than ever, and wrote students up for things like "breathing loudly" and "looking happy".&lt;ref name="CS9" /&gt;

Sometime in January, 1993, [[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]] flooded her bathroom after [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] tried to dispose of [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|Tom Riddle's diary]] in her bathroom. Filch shouted in a hysterical voice about all the work he would have mopping up all night, and ran to Headmaster Dumbledore slamming a door behind him.&lt;ref name="CS13" /&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter2-teachers in hallway.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The professors and Filch moments after Ginny Weasley was kidnapped by the monster]]

In early February, [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] kindly assured Filch she would have [[Mrs Norris]] back in no time, as the [[Mandrake]]s, who were maturing for the Mandrake Restorative Draught, were already moody, secretive, and with acne.&lt;ref name="CS13" /&gt; Filch was also present when in a corridor with all the other staff when a new message from the Heir of Slytherin appeared on the wall stating that Ginny had been taken into the chamber and that her skeleton will lie there forever.

At the end of the year, Filch attended the End-of-Term Feast, reunited with his cat.&lt;ref name="CSf36"&gt;{{COS|F}} - Chapter 36 (''Welcome Back'')&lt;/ref&gt; His cat was cured via the administration of Professor Sprout’s  [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]], brewed with Professor Sprout's Mandrakes.&lt;ref name="CS18"&gt;{{COS|B|18}} &lt;/ref&gt; He learned that the one who petrified Mrs Norris was the memory of Tom Riddle, the one who controlled [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]].

====1993–1994 school year====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Argus Filch|What are you doing?|Harry Potter|Nothing.|Nothing! A likely story!

[[File:Harry-potter1-filch_ps.jpg|250px|thumb|Filch during the [[Start-of-Term Feast]]]]

During the next school year, the alleged mass-murderer [[Sirius Black]] escaped from [[Azkaban]] and the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] stationed [[Dementor]]s around the entrances to the grounds in order to protect the school and [[Harry Potter]], which was thought to be Black's target.&lt;ref name="PA5"&gt;{{POA|B|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September, 1993, Filch attended the Start-of-Term Feast, and stood in the raised platform by the High Table while the school choir and orchestra led a presentation of ''[[Double Trouble|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]''.&lt;ref name="PAf8"&gt;{{POA|F}} - Chapter 8 (''Welcome and Warning'')&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October, Filch stood by the [[Entrance Hall]] checking the names of those going to the first [[Hogsmeade weekend trips|Hogsmeade trip]] of the term. He later told Harry Potter off for wandering around on his own, which he thought suspicious.&lt;ref name="PA8"&gt;{{POA|B|8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter3_filch.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Argus Filch and [[Albus Dumbledore]] talking to the Fat Lady]]

Later in the evening of that same day, Sirius Black broke into the Castle and tried to enter [[Gryffindor Tower]]; this resulted in the destruction of the Fat Lady's portrait.&lt;ref name="PA8" /&gt; Filch helped secure the Castle on [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s instruction, lowering the portcullis and bolting the front doors of the Clock Tower.&lt;ref name="PAf14"&gt;{{POA|F}} - Chapter 14 (''Substitute Teacher'')&lt;/ref&gt; Filch searched both the dungeons,&lt;ref name="PA8" /&gt; the [[Astronomy Tower]] and the Owlery,&lt;ref name="PAf14" /&gt; but found no sign of him. Filch was also charged with restoring the Fat Lady's portrait,&lt;ref name="PA8" /&gt; and he did so expertly.&lt;ref name="PA14"&gt;{{POA|B|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Harry Potter was given the [[Marauder's Map]] by Fred and George Weasley, using it to sneak into [[Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Village]] and walk throughout the castle, without Filch noticing him.&lt;ref name="PA10" /&gt;

In December, Filch attended the Christmas feast, in which he departed with his usual brown coat and wore a very old and rather mouldy-looking tailcoat.&lt;ref name="PA11"&gt;{{POA|B|11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sirius Black's second break-in in the evening of 5 February, Filch bustled around the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes.&lt;ref name="PA14" /&gt;

====1994–1995 school year====

Before the start of the school term, Filch extended the list of forbidden objects within the school premises so that it included four hundred and thirty-seven items, including [[Screaming Yo-yo]]s, [[Fanged Frisbee]]s, and [[Ever-Bashing Boomerang]]s.&lt;ref name="GF12"&gt;{{GOF|B|12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-filch great hall.jpg|250px|thumb|Filch was present when students from Durmstrang arrived]]

That school year, the Triwizard Tournament took place at Hogwarts. Delegations of students from [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] and [[Durmstrang Institute]] came to Hogwarts in order to watch the Tournament and sign up to be chosen as one of the champions.&lt;ref name="GF12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GF15"&gt;{{GOF|B|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, Filch underwent an extra-thorough cleaning of the Castle and acted ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes. On one occasion, he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.&lt;ref name="GF15" /&gt; During the [[Hallowe'en feast]] on 31 October, Filch wore his mouldy old tailcoat and added chairs to accommodate [[Igor Karkaroff]], [[Olympe Maxime]], [[Ludovic Bagman]], and [[Bartemius Crouch Senior]] at the Staff Table. Filch, later, brought the jewel-encrusted casket with the [[Goblet of Fire]] inside.&lt;ref name="GF16"&gt;{{GOF|B|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On several occasions in December, Filch had to take [[Peeves]] from inside suits of armour, where he had taken to hide, singing Christmas carols with very rude lyrics of his own invention.&lt;ref name="GF22"&gt;{{GOF|B|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-filch yule ball.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Filch attending the Yule Ball with Mrs Norris]]Filch attended the Yule Ball on Christmas night, where he stood alone with Mrs Norris on his arms humming the waltz tunes to his cat.&lt;ref name="GFf"&gt;{{GOF|F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the night of 21 January, 1995, Filch almost caught Harry Potter while he was on his way back to [[Gryffindor Tower]] after having been in the Prefects' bathroom trying to solve the [[golden egg]] riddle for the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Harry sank into one of the trick steps and got stuck in it, making his golden egg break open and wail. Hearing this, Filch thought that Peeves stole the egg. This made him even more hopeful that Dumbledore would kick Peeves out of Hogwarts for it. Filch was then joined by [[Severus Snape]] when the two got hold of Harry's egg and the [[Marauder's Map]]. As Snape discussed with Filch, he wanted to take those objects in order to find who they belonged to (suspecting that they were Harry's). He also told him that someone had broken into his personal office.

[[File:Flitwick mourning Cedric.jpg|250px|thumb|Filch, Professor Flitwick, and Professor McGonagall at Cedric Diggory's memorial service]]

Then, Professor [[Alastor Moody]] (actually [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] under the [[Polyjuice Potion]]) appeared and made them leave, convincing them that no one was there, saving Harry and later giving Harry's things back.&lt;ref name="GF25"&gt;{{GOF|B|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the year, champion [[Cedric Diggory]] was murdered, while everyone learned from Harry about [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s return. The [[Second Wizarding War]] began.&lt;ref name="GF35"&gt;{{GOF|B|35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Filch Umbridge promo 1.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Filch and [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor]] [[Dolores Umbridge]]]]

After [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s return, and as part of its campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] instated [[Dolores Umbridge]] as [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor.&lt;ref name="OP11"&gt;{{OOTP|B|11}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the start of the school term, Filch fastened the list of forbidden items to his office door in an attempt to make students read it. He also told [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], in what he said was the four-hundred-and-sixty second time, to remind the students that magic was not permitted in corridors between classes.&lt;ref name="OP11" /&gt;

Filch attended the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] in the evening of 1 September, 1995 in which he stood by the double doors leading to the [[Entrance Hall]], and listened attentively to Dolores Umbridge's speech. He apparently realised the Ministry of Magic was going to interfere at Hogwarts that school year, and clapped enthusiastically.&lt;ref name="OPf"&gt;{{OOTP|F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umbridge was a sadistic woman who, like Filch, enjoyed torturing and punishing students. Thus, the caretaker started to support Umbridge and follow her orders.

On 7 September, Filch got a tip-off that Harry Potter was sending in a massive order of Dungbombs. When he got to the [[Owlery]], he found Harry Potter (who had just sent a letter for [[Sirius Black]]) and [[Cho Chang]] (who was sending her mother a parcel for her birthday).&lt;ref name="OP14" /&gt; [[Hermione Granger]] later speculated that this was Umbridge's doing, as she probably needed an excuse to read Harry's post.&lt;ref name="OP18"&gt;{{OOTP|B|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Cho vouched for Harry and stated that he was not ordering Dungbombs.

[[File:Filch educational decree.jpg|249x249px|thumb|Filch posting an Educational Decree]]

With the passing of [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three]], which appointed Dolores Umbridge to the post of High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, the Ministry effectively started its interference at the school.&lt;ref name="OP15"&gt;{{OOTP|B|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umbridge started passing Educational Decrees to suppress and outlaw behaviour of which the Ministry did not approve.&lt;ref name="OP17"&gt;{{OOTP|B|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the morning before the first school trip to [[Hogsmeade]] of the school year, Filch matched the names of those visiting the village to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to do so. When [[Harry Potter]] reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though to detect a whiff of [[Dungbomb]]s.&lt;ref name="OP16"&gt;{{OOTP|B|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Odf-promocional-trelawney.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Filch assisting Professor Trelawney with her luggage|alt=]]

On 7 October, Filch hung a copy of the [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four]] on the Entrance Hall.&lt;ref name="OPf" /&gt; He was also probably the one to affix the notices with the Decree on the noticeboards of the Common Rooms.&lt;ref name="OP17" /&gt; Filch also assisted Umbridge when she had Trelawney sacked, something he most likely took pleasure in, as it caused Trelawney great stress and reduced her to tears.

On [[Valentine's Day]], 1996, Harry Potter and Cho Chang departed for Hogsmeade together. Filch signed the students out in a queue in the Entrance Hall.&lt;ref name="OP25"&gt;{{OOTP|B|25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same month, after [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|Gryffindor]]'s abysmal performance in their [[Quidditch]] match against [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team|Hufflepuff]], the [[Slytherin]] sang ''Weasley is Our King'' so loudly and frequently that Filch banned the song from the corridors out of sheer irritation.&lt;ref name="OP26"&gt;{{OOTP|B|26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inquisitorial.png|250px|thumb|right|Filch with Dolores Umbridge and the [[Inquisitorial Squad]] catching Dumbledore's Army]]

In the evening of 20 April, 1996, [[Marietta Edgecombe]] denounced the unsanctioned Dumbledore's Army to Dolores Umbridge. Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad then managed to catch the students leaving the [[Room of Requirement]] and Harry Potter, head of the organisation, was taken to the Headmaster's office while joined by Umbridge, Edgecombe, Deputy Headmistress [[Minerva McGonagall]], the Minister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] and his Junior Assistant [[Percy Weasley]], and two [[Auror]]s.

Professor Dumbledore took full responsibility for the group, and was to be escorted to the Ministry, where he would be formally charged, and then sent to [[Azkaban]] to await trial for conspiracy and sedition. Dumbledore then knocked down the Ministry officials, and left the school undetected.&lt;ref name="OP27"&gt;{{OOTP|B|27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry passed the [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Eight]] overnight, making Dolores Umbridge Headmistress of Hogwarts.&lt;ref name="OP28"&gt;{{OOTP|B|28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-filch_umbridge.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Headmistress Dolores Umbridge and Filch look in shock as [[Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs]] spread through the school]]

Under Umbridge, Filch walked around in an extremely good mood. He hummed creakily under his breath, under the prospect of the changes Umbridge had announced him. He was going to be permitted to bring back the "old punishments" and give students whippings, and she asked the Minister for Magic to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves, the resident [[Poltergeist]].&lt;ref name="OP28" /&gt; However, the counterattack against Umbridge was now in full force: much of the student body opposed Umbridge and Filch. 

On the former's first afternoon as Headmistress, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] set off an enormous crate of Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs which spread all over the school. At the end of the day, Umbridge was dishevelled, sweaty-faced and soot-blackened from trying to extinguish the fireworks, and Filch set one of his brooms ablaze when he tried to swat at the fireworks in midair.&lt;ref name="OP28" /&gt; Harry Potter helped [[Dean Thomas]] mess up the clock in the Clock Tower, [[Colin Creevey]] sent the Inquisitorial Squad several rude Howlers in chocolate boxes, and [[Parvati Patil|Parvati]] and [[Padma Patil]] poured [[Babbling Beverage]] into the [[Hogwarts school loudspeakers|school loudspeakers]].&lt;ref name="OPvg"&gt;{{OOTP|G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after the Easter holidays, Fred and George Weasley set off a [[Portable Swamp]] on the Fifth Floor Corridor, and left the school in a blaze of glory.&lt;ref name="OP29"&gt;{{OOTP|B|29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not leave instructions on how to remove the swamp and as such, Umbridge and Filch tried fruitlessly different means of removing it. The other teachers, who could have removed the swamp in an instant, preferred instead to watch Umbridge struggle. The area was roped off, and Filch was given the task of getting students across it to their classrooms in a small punt.&lt;ref name="OP30"&gt;{{OOTP|B|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Filch Portable Swamp.png|250px|thumb|Filch wading through the [[Portable Swamp|swamped]] [[Fifth-floor corridor|Fifth Floor Corridor]]]]

Inspired by the twins' legendary flight to freedom, a great number of students wreaked havoc in the school: [[Lee Jordan]]&lt;ref name="OP31"&gt;{{OOTP|B|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; put [[Niffler]]s into Umbridge's office, which promptly tore the place apart while searching for shiny objects and leapt on Umbridge when she entered, trying to gnaw the rings off her fingers. Dungbombs and [[Stink Pellets]] were frequently dropped in the corridors, so that students performed [[Bubble-Head Charm]]s on themselves to get a supply of fresh air.&lt;ref name="OP30" /&gt; Due to all those misdeeds, Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch students in the act, but the problem was that there were now so many of them, he never knew which way to turn. He was aided by the Inquisitorial Squad, but odd things like antlers sprouting from their heads kept happening to its members.&lt;ref name="OP30" /&gt;

No one, however, could compete with the master of chaos, [[Peeves]]. On two occasions, he shut [[Mrs Norris]] inside a suit of armour, from which she was rescued by a furious Filch, yowling loudly.&lt;ref name="OP30" /&gt;

After the [[Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest|skirmish]] between Umbridge and the Forbidden Forest centaur herd and the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] on 18 June, Umbridge was confined to the [[Hospital Wing]] in what [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] said was a case of shock. Umbridge left [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] the day before the end of term, having crept out during dinnertime in hope to depart undetected. She, however, met Peeves on the way, who chased her from the premises, whacking her alternately with Minerva McGonagall's walking stick and a sock full of chalk as the students and teachers watched.&lt;ref name="OP38"&gt;{{OOTP|B|38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filch brought her her luggage, as she was stopped by a mob of ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' reporters who took pictures of her escape.&lt;ref name="OPf" /&gt; Filch was reportedly miserable, as he thought Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts.&lt;ref name="OP38" /&gt;

Umbridge's Educational Decrees were abolished, as well as her [[Approval for Whipping]], as Albus Dumbledore was reinstated as Headmaster, meaning that he never got the opportunity to inflict corporal punishment on the students.

====1996–1997 school year====

[[File:Filch secrecy sensor HBP concept 01.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Filch examining the students' possessions that are brought into Hogwarts, using a [[Secrecy Sensor]]]]

Now in open war, upon the students' arrival at the school on 1 September, 1996, Filch was charged with checking the students and their possessions for dark objects with Secrecy Sensors. Filch confiscated a shrunken head from [[Vincent Crabbe]]. Filch also had the responsibility of checking all the owls to prevent potentially harmful objects from entering the premises.&lt;ref name="HBP11"&gt;{{HBP|B|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Start-of-Term Feast, [[Albus Dumbledore]] informed the students that Filch had asked him to remind the them that there was a blanket ban on any joke items bought at [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]'s shop, [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]].&lt;ref name="HBP8"&gt;{{HBP|B|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filch, however, was hoodwinked by Fred and George's Owl order service, in which their products came disguised as perfumes and cough potions.&lt;ref name="HBP15"&gt;{{HBP|B|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Harry Potter]]'s discovery of the Half-Blood Prince's [[Severus Snape's copy of Advanced Potion-Making|copy]] of ''[[Advanced Potion-Making]]'', he learnt several new spells such as ''[[Langlock]]'', a [[jinx]] that glued the victim's tongue to the roof of the mouth. Harry cast this jinx twice, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch.&lt;ref name="HBP12"&gt;{{HBP|B|12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, Filch stood as usual in the Entrance Hall checking the names of students who had permission to go in a Hogsmeade weekend trip. The process took longer than normal as Filch triple-checked everybody with his Secrecy Sensor. [[Ronald Weasley]] demanded to know what did it matter if the students were smuggling Dark objects out of the premises, and his cheek earned him a few jabs with the Sensor.&lt;ref name="HBP12" /&gt; When the students arrived after the attack on [[Katie Bell]], who had touched a cursed necklace, Filch held his secrecy sensor aloft, but was dismissed by [[Minerva McGonagall]] who told him to take the necklace, wrapped in a scarf, to [[Severus Snape]], the school's expert on [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].&lt;ref name="HBP12" /&gt;

On 19 December, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger argued and speculated whether or not Filch and [[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]] were secretly in love with each other.&lt;ref name="HBP15" /&gt;

[[File:Filch draco hbp.jpg|250px|thumb|Filch carries Draco Malfoy to Professor Slughorn's Christmas party]]

In the evening of the Slug Club Christmas party, on 20 December, Filch caught [[Draco Malfoy]] lurking in an upstairs corridor, most likely going to the [[Room of Requirement]] to repair the [[Vanishing Cabinet]]. In an excuse to escape punishment, Draco told Filch he had been invited to [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s party, and Filch dragged him by the ear to Slughorn's office to see if his claim was true. Once there, Slughorn said that he had not issued him an invitation. Draco then told Filch that he was trying to gatecrash. Filch said that this did not make him happy, but the look on his face seemed to say otherwise, but as it was Christmas, Slughorn let Draco stay with no punishment.&lt;ref name="HBP15" /&gt;

In the evening of 1 March, 1997, as [[Rubeus Hagrid]] was escorting Harry Potter and [[Hermione Granger]] from the [[Hospital Wing]] where [[Ronald Weasley]] stayed after ingesting poisoned mead, Filch came across them threatening the students with detention. Hagrid vouched for them, but Filch rudely undermined Hagrid's authority as a teacher, with Hagrid insulting Filch for being a Squib in retaliation. and the two argued loudly as Harry and Hermione hurried off on Hagrid's instruction.&lt;ref name="HBP19"&gt;{{HBP|B|19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March, Filch did his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor as some of the sixth years departed the school for an [[Apparition (class)|Apparition]] lesson at [[Hogsmeade]].&lt;ref name="HBP21"&gt;{{HBP|B|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter1-filch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Filch lurking the halls in order to catch students out of bed]]On the evening of [[Aragog]]'s [[Funeral of Aragog|funeral]], Harry Potter, presumably as a consequence of having taken [[Felix Felicis]], strolled the Castle on his way to Hagrid's cabin in the grounds without meeting anyone in his way. Upon arriving at the Entrance Hall, he found that Filch had forgotten to lock the front doors. Harry met Horace Slughorn by the [[Hogwarts greenhouses|Herbology greenhouses]] and told him this, in which the professor said he would be reporting Filch, as "''he's more concerned about litter than proper security''". As a result, Harry managed to take information from Slughorn about the [[Horcrux]]es Voldemort created in order to become immortal, and how he could destroy them.&lt;ref name="HBP22"&gt;{{HBP|B|22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filch had been looking for someone to clear out his old punishment files, and when Severus Snape put Harry Potter in detention for hurting Draco Malfoy, he put Harry to work by making him copying out the misdeeds and punishments afresh and making sure that they were in alphabetical order without the aid of magic.&lt;ref name="HBP24" /&gt;

On 30 June, 1997, a small gang of [[Death Eaters]] managed to penetrate the magical protections around the Castle with the help of [[Draco Malfoy]] and an assault took place at the [[Astronomy Tower]] and the corridors beneath it. Severus Snape joined them, and killed Albus Dumbledore atop the Tower&lt;ref name="HBP27"&gt;{{HBP|B|27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in fact, Snape was a double agent and was working on Dumbledore's orders, meaning since Dumbledore was already slowly dying, Snape's killing of him was a mercy killing).&lt;ref name="DH33"&gt;{{DH|B|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|Dumbledore's funeral, that Filch attended]]

In July, Argus Filch attended [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's funeral]] in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs, paying his respects for the man who, despite their opposing views on student punishment, gave him employment as a [[Squib]].&lt;ref name="HBP30"&gt;{{HBP|B|30}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his funeral he sat next to Irma Pince, something Harry Potter took notice of, as he suspected a romantic relationship between the two.

====1997–1998 school year====
{{Dialogue|Filch|Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!|Minerva McGonagall|They're supposed to be you blithering idiot! Now go and do something constructive! Find Peeves!|Filch's task moments prior to the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
On 1 August, 1997, the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was taken over by Lord Voldemort's [[Death Eaters]].&lt;ref name="DH8"&gt;{{DH|B|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1 September, 1997, [[Severus Snape]] was made Headmaster of Hogwarts while his fellow Death Eaters, [[Alecto Carrow]] and [[Amycus Carrow]] became the [[Muggle Studies]] and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teachers respectively, as well as Deputy Heads.&lt;ref name="DH12"&gt;{{DH|B|12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, which were violent, including beatings and placing students under the [[Cruciatus Curse]].&lt;ref name="DH29"&gt;{{DH|B|29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filch was kept working at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in his capacity of caretaker. It is unknown what was made of Filch, or even if he was mistreated by the Carrows simply for being a [[Squib]]. Apparently, Filch lost some of his duties, as punishment seemed to be given out exclusively by the Carrows and Severus Snape.

[[File:Argus Filch in the Dungeons.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Filch before the Battle of Hogwarts]]

In the evening of 1 May, Argus Filch was patrolling the corridors while [[Harry Potter]] and [[Luna Lovegood]] went to [[Ravenclaw Tower]].&lt;ref name="DH29" /&gt; Later, after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] gained knowledge from [[Alecto Carrow]] that Harry Potter was in the school premises, the [[Head of House|Heads of House]] started conjuring protective enchantments around the school, preparing to fight and waking up students. Filch, unaware of what was happening, came to Professor McGonagall shouting that students were out of bed. Frustrated, McGonagall sent him to do something constructive and find [[Peeves]], for the [[Poltergeist]] would be helpful against the [[Death Eaters]]. Though clearly thinking that Professor McGonagall had gone insane, Filch complied.&lt;ref name="DH30" /&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter7-filch slughorn.jpg|250px|thumb|Slughorn treating Flich's arm during the one hour armistice]]

Later on, Filch and [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] oversaw the evacuation procedure of underage students and of those not willing to fight, via the [[Room of Requirement]].&lt;ref name="DH31"&gt;{{DH|B|21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caretaker stayed in the Castle during the battle,&lt;ref name="DHpt2"&gt;{{DH|F2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is unknown how, as a Squib, he participated in the battle; perhaps he stayed to tend to the fighters' injuries or to aid the Hogwarts forces with his extensive knowledge of the Castle layout and secret passages. During the first stage of the battle, Filch was left with a deep gash in his left arm.&lt;ref name="DHpt2" /&gt; During the one hour-long interruption in the battle, Filch was at the [[Great Hall]], where his injuries were treated by [[Horace Slughorn]].&lt;ref name="DHpt2" /&gt;

[[File:HP72-FP-00573-900x506.jpg|245px|thumb|left|Filch and others grimly watch as Harry's "dead body" is presented]]

When the Death Eaters marched to Hogwarts Castle with Harry Potter's "dead body", Filch stood by [[Pomona Sprout]], [[Poppy Pomfrey]], and [[Horace Slughorn]] with a gloomy expression on his face.&lt;ref name="DHpt2" /&gt; The battle recommenced shortly afterwards, and it all ended when Lord Voldemort was finally defeated and killed by Harry Potter in the Great Hall.&lt;ref name="DH36"&gt;{{DH|B|36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the battle, Filch grimly looked at a large pile of rubble in the [[Entrance Hall]], which he dutifully began trying to sweep up, while the fighters gathered in the Great Hall mourning over the dead, and celebrating over their victory.&lt;ref name="DHpt2" /&gt;

===Later life===
[[File:Argus Filch in the Great Hall MA.png|thumb|222x222px|Argus Filch in the Great Hall]]
After the battle, he returned to his position of [[Hogwarts Caretaker|caretaker]], as he was immediately seen sweeping near the Great Hall.&lt;ref name="DHpt2" /&gt; He presumably kept doing what he was used to: punishing the students and arguing with [[Peeves]] the [[Poltergeist]], even under the new [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] [[Minerva McGonagall]].

==Physical appearance==
[[File:Filchcloseup.jpg|249px|thumb|right|Argus Filch]]
Argus Filch was a [[rheumatism|rheumatic]] man&lt;ref name="OP28" /&gt; with hunched-shoulders&lt;ref name="DH30" /&gt; and a [[wikipedia:Kyphosis|hunchback]].&lt;ref name="HBP19" /&gt; He had a horrible, pouchy&lt;ref name="GF25" /&gt; and pasty face&lt;ref name="CS8" /&gt; and bulging, pale eyes,&lt;ref name="PS12" /&gt; along with sunken, veined cheeks.&lt;ref name="OP14" /&gt; He had long hair with a bald spot on the top of his head and quivery jowls.&lt;ref name="OP14" /&gt; Skinny-ankled,&lt;ref name="HBP19" /&gt; Filch would usually wheeze&lt;ref name="PS8" /&gt; and shuffle when walking.&lt;ref name="CS8" /&gt; He had knobbly hands and whenever he got the [[flu]], a bulbous and unusually purple nose.&lt;ref name="CS8" /&gt;

Filch usually wore a brown coat,&lt;ref name="PA11" /&gt; although on special occasions he would wear a mouldy-looking tailcoat&lt;ref name="PA11" /&gt; or an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs.&lt;ref name="HBP30" /&gt; At night, while not patrolling the corridors, Filch wore an old flannel dressing gown.&lt;ref name="GF25" /&gt;

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|If Filch’s trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates students so much. He’s bitter.|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s explanation of Filch's grouchy personality|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
Very foul-tempered, cantankerous, and easily annoyed, Filch had an extremely unpleasant personality. Despite working at a school, Filch deeply resented the students and was greatly disliked by them in return,&lt;ref name="PS8" /&gt; and some members of the staff, as well. However, when called on to oversee the evacuation of the majority of the students before the Battle of Hogwarts, Filch led the children to safety without hesitation.&lt;ref name="DH30" /&gt; In keeping with his dislike for students and their inevitable tendency to create messes and disorder (which he, as caretaker, would get stuck cleaning up), Filch idolised "the old ways" of discipline and constantly lamented that he was no longer allowed to use corporal punishment.&lt;ref name="PS15" /&gt; Filch was obsessed with keeping the Castle neat and tidy, and was infuriated when students made a mess with potion ingredients, or forgot to wipe their feet.&lt;ref name="CS8" /&gt;

He was also very domineering, controlling and paranoid, as demonstrated by the numerous times he asked students what they were doing when they were simply wandering around in what he thought was a suspicious manner.&lt;ref name="PA8" /&gt;

He seemed to be bitter and embarrassed about not being able to use [[magic]], as was demonstrated when [[Harry Potter]] accidentally discovered his [[Kwikspell]] letters in [[1992]].&lt;ref name="CS8" /&gt; [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] also suspected that Filch was always in such a foul mood due to his status as a [[Squib]], and thus resented young wizards and witches as a result.&lt;ref name="CS9" /&gt; Filch also had a difficulty in recognising [[potion]]s, due to his lack of magical knowledge as he did not notice the [[Love Potion]]s disguised as perfumes and [[cough potion]]s by the [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]],&lt;ref name="HBP15" /&gt; nor did he notice the [[poison]]ed [[mead]] sent in by [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] (while under the [[Imperius Curse]] cast by [[Draco Malfoy]]), showing he was not particularly observant despite his obsessive personality. 

Filch also did not suspect anything that was from Rosmerta, another factor that would have permitted the necklace and poisoned mead to enter the castle as well as a flaw that Draco attempted to take advantage of.&lt;ref name="HBP27" /&gt; His obsession with the castle's cleanliness led him to neglect actual security at times, as he forgot to lock the doors at least one time even in the more dangerous hours, something Slughorn reprimanded him for.&lt;ref name="HBP22" /&gt;

===Punishing in old ways===
{{Quote|I'd appreciate it if you stopped trying to inch me closer to the shackles, Mr Filch.|[[Jacob's sibling]] talking to Filch in his office|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
Argus Filch seemed so interested in punishing rebellious students in the old manners.

It is rumoured that he used to clean the shackles in his office hoping the [[Albus Dumbledore|Headmaster]] would let him use them on students again one day. He also asked the Headmaster to let him use the shackles on Jacob's sibling as they were, in his eyes, very rebellious for facing the [[Cursed Vaults]]&lt;ref&gt;{{HM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I can't remember which part exactly it was--&gt;

==Relationships==
===Mrs Norris===
{{Quote|Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.|Filch talking to Mrs Norris|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Filch &amp; Mrs Norris.jpg|259x259px|thumb|left|Argus with his cat, [[Mrs Norris]]]]
Possibly the only being in Hogwarts that Filch actually liked was his beloved [[cat]], [[Mrs Norris]].&lt;ref name="CS9" /&gt; She had dust-coloured fur and yellow, lamp-like eyes. Mrs Norris, like her master, was infamously bad-tempered with anyone but Filch himself. The two shared a strong bond that linked them somehow; anytime Mrs Norris spotted someone breaking a rule, Filch would arrive soon afterwards.&lt;ref name="PS8" /&gt; 

Filch talked to her and called her "my sweet".&lt;ref name="PS9" /&gt; When she was [[Petrification|Petrified]] by [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]], Filch was devastated and started sobbing, which made [[Harry Potter]] feel slightly sorry for him, though he felt a lot more sorry for himself, fearing he might be expelled.&lt;ref name="CS9" /&gt; Filch even threatened Harry after finding him standing by the petrified Mrs Norris, Dumbledore had to calm him down. It can be assumed that Filch was grateful after Mrs Norris was cured.

===Peeves===
{{Quote|PEEVES! What's this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I'll have you, Peeves, I'll have you, you'll… and what is this? Egg? My sweet! This is a Triwizard clue! This belongs to a school champion! PEEVES! You've been stealing! Hiding, are you?

[[File:Peeves-PM-17-10-17.gif|293x293px|thumb|right|[[Peeves]], the Hogwarts Poltergeist and his archenemy]]
Filch fought a running war with Peeves, the [[Poltergeist]], and the two were sworn enemies for more than twenty-five years.&lt;ref name="DH30" /&gt; Filch never ceased his futile efforts to get Peeves expelled from the castle, and Peeves never stopped taunting Filch. 

To annoy Filch, Peeves would trap Mrs Norris in [[Suit of armour|suits of armour]],&lt;ref name="OP30" /&gt; drop chandeliers,&lt;ref name="OP30" /&gt; play tennis against the Castle walls in the middle of the night,&lt;ref name="PS14" /&gt; stick wads of gum in keyholes&lt;ref name="PA7"&gt;{{POA|B|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caused general mayhem, which Filch was later responsible for fixing and cleaning up. It is presumed that this on-going war between them continued after the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

===Fred and George Weasley===

[[File:DH1 promo formal wear Fred and George.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|244x244px|[[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]]]
The twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] had as bad a relationship with Filch as Filch had had with Peeves ever since their first year. Sometime in [[1989]] or [[1990]], Fred and George let off a [[Dungbomb]] and were caught by Filch, who took them to his office and threatened them with his usual unpleasant punishments he always had in mind. The twins noticed a filing cabinet marked ''Confiscated and Highly Dangerous'' so, curious, they let off another Dungbomb in his office and "nicked" the [[Marauder's Map]], which was stored inside that drawer, from him.&lt;ref name="PA10" /&gt; 

The caretaker had punished them many times during their Hogwarts years, for their trouble-making. Among his many file cabinets documenting the punishments he handed out over the years, Filch had an entire drawer dedicated to the twins.&lt;ref name="CS8" /&gt; Upon the opening of the [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]], Filch has placed a blanket ban on all the joke items that could be purchased at their shop, but the twins managed to sneak past security by disguising all their [[Love Potion]]s as [[cough potion]]s and perfumes.&lt;ref name="HBP15" /&gt;

===Harry Potter===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Argus Filch|The Headmistress would like to see you, Potter.|Harry Potter|I didn't do it.|Guilty conscience, eh? Follow me.|Argus Filch takes Harry Potter to Headmistress [[Dolores Umbridge]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Hbp harry potter.jpg|alt=|thumb|274x274px|[[Harry Potter]], a student he particularly disliked]]
Although Filch disliked most students, Harry Potter was one of those he disliked most. In 1991, Harry and Ron managed to get on Filch's bad side on their very first day at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]], when he and [[Ronald Weasley]] got lost and inadvertently tried to enter the out-of-bounds [[third-floor corridor]].&lt;ref name="PS8" /&gt; 

The next school year, Filch was furious when Harry learnt that he was a [[Squib]].&lt;ref name="CS8" /&gt; Then, he believed that Harry was the one who petrified [[Mrs Norris]], Filch's cat, as he was one of the few people who knew he was a Squib.&lt;ref name="CS9" /&gt; 

During the next years, Harry disliked Filch even more, especially when the caretaker took the side of Dolores Umbridge, during Harry's fifth year.&lt;ref name="OP28" /&gt; 

Due to Harry's dislike of Filch, Harry twice [[jinx]]ed him with ''[[Langlock]]'' in his [[sixth year]], humiliating Filch much to the amusement of everyone who witnessed it.&lt;ref name="HBP12" /&gt;

However, Filch, in a way, helped Harry Potter and the [[Order of the Phoenix]] defeat the [[Death Eaters]], as he helped McGonagall call Peeves during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].&lt;ref name="DH30" /&gt; During the Battle, when the Death Eaters marched towards the Castle with Harry's "dead body", he was clearly solemn as he stood by [[Horace Slughorn]], [[Pomona Sprout]], and [[Poppy Pomfrey]],&lt;ref name="DHpt2" /&gt; despite all their differences, as his death meant the victory of the [[Death Eaters]].

===Dolores Umbridge===
{{Dialogue a-b|Dolores Umbridge|Hurry, Filch, hurry! ''[The fireworks]'' 'll be all over the school unless we do something — ''Stupefy!'' Don't Stun them, Filch!|Argus Filch|Right you are, Headmistress!|Umbridge stuns one of the Weasley twins' [[Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs]], and blames it on Filch|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Dolores Umbridge.jpg|253x253px|thumb|left|[[Dolores Umbridge]]]]
As Dolores Umbridge was a sadist who enjoyed torturing students, Filch could relate to her views on a number of levels.&lt;ref name="OP28" /&gt; Also, as Umbridge [[Approval for Whipping|granted]] Filch permission to torture misbehaving students,&lt;ref name="OP29" /&gt; whereas Dumbledore would never even think of such things, he had loyalty to her.&lt;ref name="OP28" /&gt; He was one of the few people who actually liked her at the school.&lt;ref name="OP30" /&gt;

Umbridge had gone through great lengths to gain Filch's loyalty, such as giving him permission to torture, and to have Peeves dismissed, due to Filch's knowledge around the school's secret passageways being second only to the Weasley twins.&lt;ref name="OP28" /&gt; Otherwise, she did have a low opinion of him, telling him not to [[Stunning Spell|stun]] some [[Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs|enchanted fireworks]] and having it explode all over the place, when it was in fact her own doing.&lt;ref name="OP28" /&gt;

===Severus Snape===
{{Dialogue a-b|Argus Filch|You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section.|Severus Snape|The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.|Filch and [[Severus Snape|Snape]] try to catch and punish students|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Severus Snape.jpg|269x269px|thumb|right|Professor [[Severus Snape]]]]
As [[Severus Snape]] was a very strict and somewhat cruel teacher, Filch respected that and acted a loyal subordinate to him.&lt;ref name="PS11" /&gt; They both very much liked to give students a hard time, unfair punishments, and cruel aspects of such punishments.&lt;ref name="HBP12" /&gt; Snape, however, did not show much respect to the caretaker, and simply treated him as a minion.&lt;ref name="GF25" /&gt; Furthermore, while Snape gave some leniency to students of [[Slytherin]], Filch saw no such mercy with any of the students.&lt;ref name="HBP15" /&gt; Filch was also caretaker when Snape was a student at Hogwarts.&lt;ref name="HBP24" /&gt;  The one thing that the two absolutely agreed on was a mutual dislike of Harry Potter.

During his tenure as [[Headmaster]], Snape kept Filch working at Hogwarts despite his status as a [[Squib]].&lt;ref name="DH29" /&gt; It is unknown whether this was for his loyalty to Snape, his long years of service to the school, or his ability to catch troublemakers through his extensive knowledge of the Castle's secrets.

===Irma Pince===
[[File:PinceProfile.png|241x241px|thumb|left|[[Irma Pince]]]]
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|She'll ban you from the library if you're not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?|Harry Potter|It's not my fault she's barking mad, Hermione. Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I've always thought there might be something between them...|[[Harry Potter]] speculates about a relationship between Pince and Filch|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Harry Potter once speculated that there was "something going on" romantically between Filch and [[Irma Pince]], the equally ancient and irascible Hogwarts librarian.&lt;ref name="HBP15"/&gt; Unbeknownst to Harry, Filch and Pince had indeed shared a romantic relationship starting in [[1989]], when the two attended the [[Valentine's Day Ball]] together.&lt;ref name="VDB"/&gt; It's unclear whether the relationship was still going on by the time Harry attended Hogwarts, but he did see them at Dumbledore's funeral together.&lt;ref name="HBP30"/&gt;

He admitted he liked that "''Madam Pince won't stand for rule breaking''" and he liked it "''in a witch''".&lt;ref&gt;{{HM|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hogwarts staff===
[[File:;io.PNG|210px|thumb|right|Filch and [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]]]
Filch's relationship with most professors was unknown. The only thing that is known is that he respected many of them, and did what they say without question.&lt;ref name="HBP15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HBP12" /&gt; Most of the staff appeared to dislike Filch's grumpy and antipathetic personality, such as [[Minerva McGonagall]], who could often be irritated by his behaviour (to the point of forgoing her usual politeness with fellow staff by calling him a "blithering idiot"),&lt;ref name="DH30" /&gt; and [[Horace Slughorn]], who intended to report him for being more concerned about cleaning up than with the students' security.&lt;ref name="HBP22" /&gt; Slughorn seemed to have, however, put their differences aside when he tended to Filch's injuries during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].&lt;ref name="DHpt2" /&gt; Others, like [[Pomona Sprout]], were sympathetic and kind towards him.&lt;ref name="CS13" /&gt;

Filch also appeared to respect Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] very much. Dumbledore appeared to like Filch, although the latter was unpleasant. When Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, was petrified, Dumbledore seemed to care about Filch and his cat.&lt;ref name="CS9" /&gt; However, Filch did always plead to Dumbledore to permit him to use corporeal punishments on the students, a request that was never granted, which became a primary reason why Filch preferred Umbridge as head of the school.

Filch disliked [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the Gamekeeper and later [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor.&lt;ref name="HBP19" /&gt; Filch thought that Hagrid was an oaf, and he also told Mrs Norris, his cat, to watch Hagrid when he entered the castle.&lt;ref name="PS8" /&gt; Filch also did not care for Hagrid as a professor and treated him as if he were inferior, possibly because he was half-giant.&lt;ref name="HBP19" /&gt; Hagrid, on his side, insulted Filch, calling him "''that old git''",&lt;ref name="PS8" /&gt; and a "''sneakin' Squib''", when the latter insulted him.&lt;ref name="HBP19" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The name "Argus" comes from Greek mythology, where it was the name of [[Wikipedia:Argus Panoptes|a giant with one hundred eyes]] who served the goddess [[Wikipedia:Hera|Hera]] as a watchman (much like Mr Filch's role in patrolling the hallways of Hogwarts). His surname, "Filch", is an English word meaning "to steal", usually in a sneaky manner.

==Behind the scenes==

[[File:ArgusFilchHM.png|150px|thumb|Argus Filch as depicted in {{HM}}]]
[[File:FilchLEGOHPY1-4.png|150px|thumb|Argus Filch as depicted in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
*Filch is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actor [[David Bradley]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]''.
*Filch's role in the films is much the same as his role in the books, though in the [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|fourth movie]], he was used more as a comic relief character. He was seen setting off the [[cannon]] to signal the start of a zarre manner. He was also present with Mrs Norris as Professor McGonagall conducted a dance lesson, and played the tune "[[Neville's Waltz]]" from the album ''[[Wizard Waltz]]'' for her. Similarly, in the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|fifth movie]], Filch is constantly making unsuccessful attempts to uncover [[Dumbledore's Army]], and is jinxed with [[Fever Fudge|exploding boils]] by [[Fred and George Weasley]]. In the final film instalment, Filch is once again a more comedic role: screaming that students are out of bed shortly after the [[ousting of Severus Snape]], and attempting to sweep a huge pile of rubble with his broom immediately after the Battle.
*The films omit Peeves the Poltergeist, and so Filch's ongoing war with him is omitted also.
*Filch's status as a [[Squib]] is not mentioned for most of the films — the scene when Harry discovers it in {{COS}} was deleted from the final cut. In the sixth film, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Draco refers to the caretaker's Squib status when Filch catches him in the corridor and brings him into [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn's Christmas party]].
*In the early ''Harry Potter'' [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]], Filch is seen supporting the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] during matches.
*Filch plays a minor role in {{LEGO|Y1}}. He is generally just an obstacle, introduced in "The Restricted Section" level. In most levels involving Filch, he would walk around waving his lantern, unless Mrs Norris, his cat, meowed at the player. This would cause Filch to run up to the player who attracted Mrs Norris and strangle them. While being attacked, the player must switch characters and jinx the cat, causing Filch to run away and search the nearest exit. In one bonus level, Filch and Ron must work on a team to make a [[Polyjuice Potion]], and get a Gold Brick from a [[Slytherin]]-Only Door. Being a Squib, Filch cannot do any magic and has only two actions: mêlée with his lantern, and unleash Mrs Norris, who can dig and jump over far areas.
*Despite the fact that Filch never directly participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in the book, he appears to have participated in some measure in the film. In a deleted scene, he was seen locking up all of the Slytherin students in the dungeons, although they were all freed when the dungeons were damaged in an explosion. He is seen later being tended by [[Horace Slughorn]], where Filch apparently suffered a significant gash to his arm.
*In the PC version of the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{PS}}, when Harry is escaping from the library after seeing the Mirror of Erised, he claims to have "locked the only door out of there". Said door (actually a secret passage concealed behind a bookcase) is obviously magically locked. How Filch accomplished this is unclear, given his status as a Squib.
*Interestingly, Filch's love of medieval punishments would finally be achieved when the actor who played him in the films, David Bradley, would go on to play Lord Walder Frey in the famous ''Game of Thrones'' television series. In the show, Frey was a cruel, grouchy, temperamental man (much like Filch), and committed one of the most violent acts on television, the Red Wedding, where he oversaw the brutal murders of Robb Stark and his army. He also had Catelyn Stark killed, whose actress, [[Michelle Fairley]], incidentally also played Hermione Granger's [[Hermione Granger's mother|mother]] in {{DH|F1}}.
**This role is also referenced in {{HM}}, where Filch muttered to himself that in another life, he would be a Lord.
