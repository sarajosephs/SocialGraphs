Molly says that the [[Whomping Willow]] (planted 1971) was after her time at Hogwarts (GOF, Ch. 31) and that Molly and Arthur eloped soon after graduation. (HBP - Ch. 5). In order for Bill to be conceived in wedlock, Molly must have graduated by June 1969. Given her October birthday, this graduation date requires she started Hogwarts in 1962 and was born 1950. However, as [[Arthur Weasley]] was born 6 February 1950 ( [https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/arthur-weasley Pottermore]) he would have graduated June 1968, so if he and Molly were in the same year, she would have been born in 1949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[England]],&lt;ref name="LE"&gt;{{HPLE}} - {{See image|File:MollyWeasleyMinistryFile.png}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Great Britain]]

'''Molly Weasley''' (née '''Prewett''') (b. [[30 October]]&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt; [[1949]] or [[1950]])&lt;ref name="YOB" /&gt; was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]]&lt;ref name="blood" /&gt; [[wizardkind|witch]] and matriarch of the [[Weasley family]] after marrying [[Arthur Weasley]]. She was born into the [[Prewett family]] and was sister to [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], members of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Her brothers were murdered by Death Eaters during the [[First Wizarding War]]. 

Molly attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. Sometime after she graduated, both her brothers were murdered by Death Eaters in the [[First Wizarding War]]. Molly and Arthur ended up having seven children, consisting of six sons named [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred, George]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and only one daughter named [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]. She also played a large part in the life of the famous [[Harry Potter]], acting as a motherly figure towards him. 

Molly was a member of the revived Order of the Phoenix following the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]] of the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Her actions during this battle caused her to be known as the witch that defeated and killed the notorious [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].

Molly survived the final battle to see her family expand even further. By [[2017]], she had twelve granchildren: [[Victoire Weasley]], [[Dominique Weasley]], [[Louis Weasley]], [[Molly Weasley II]], [[Lucy Weasley]], [[Fred Weasley II]], [[Roxanne Weasley]], [[Rose Granger-Weasley]],&lt;ref name="PM-CC"&gt;[https://www.pottermore.com/news/cursed-child-first-look-at-weasleys-in-character Pottermore - New Cursed Child character portraits of Ron, Hermione and Rose Granger-Weasley]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugo Granger-Weasley]],&lt;ref name="PM-CC" /&gt; [[James Potter II|James Sirius Potter]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus Potter]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]]. 

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Molly|[[Fat Lady|She]] gave me such a telling-off one night when I got back to the [[Gryffindor Tower|dormitory]] at four in the morning —|Bill Weasley|What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning?|Your father and I had been for a night-time stroll.|Molly discussing her time at Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Molly was born on [[30 October]]&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt; in [[1949]] or [[1950]]&lt;ref name="YOB" /&gt; to [[Molly Weasley's father|Mr]] and [[Molly Weasley's mother|Mrs Prewett]]. She had two brothers: Gideon and Fabian. It is unknown whether she was the middle child between them, or older or younger. Molly began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early 1960s and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. She once said that in her youth, she brewed a [[Love Potion]].&lt;ref name="POA5" /&gt;

It was at Hogwarts where Molly met [[Arthur Weasley]], whom she fell in love with and began dating. One night, they went out for a night-time stroll and whilst Arthur got caught by [[Apollyon Pringle]], she managed to get back to Gryffindor Tower at four in the morning and was told off by the [[Fat Lady]].&lt;ref name="GOF"&gt;{{GOF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Wizarding War===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Molly Weasley|It's all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so they're  rushing all sorts of decisions they'd normally take time over. It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and centre —|Ginny Weasley|Including you and Dad.|Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting?|Molly's and Arthur's rushed marriage|Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince}}
[[File:The Burrow.png|250px|thumb|left|The Burrow, where Molly and Arthur raised their family]]
Molly graduated from Hogwarts in the late 1960s. She and Arthur wed soon after.&lt;ref name="HBP5"&gt;{{HBP|B|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family lived at [[The Burrow]] on the outskirts of [[Ottery St Catchpole]] in [[Devon]]. Molly and Arthur's first child, [[William Weasley|William]], was born [[29 November]], [[1970]].&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt; More children followed: [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], and twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]]. After having her first five sons, she longed to have a daughter but when she attempted to have said daughter, she had another son, [[Ronald Weasley|Ronald]], before finally having a daughter, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginevra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DH|F1}}; mentioned by the locket in the scene where Ron destroys it.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[First Wizarding War]], Molly wasn't mentioned as a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], something that was confirmed by [[Remus Lupin]]. This is likely because she was having and taking care of many young children at the time. However, her brothers were members of the Order, but were murdered during the war by five [[Death Eaters]] in 1981, including [[Antonin Dolohov]], who was subsequently imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for the crime. Given the way she speaks about Gideon and Fabian, Molly was distraught at their deaths and may have inherited their things, as was seen by her keeping [[Fabian Prewett's watch|Fabian's watch]] for several years.

In 1987, Fred, whom along with his brother had a reputation as a prankster, burnt a hole in Ron's tongue by feeding him an [[Acid Pops|Acid Pop]]. This made Molly outraged enough to wallop the former with [[Molly Weasley's broomstick|her broomstick]]. Throughout Fred's and George's childhood, they pulled a multitude of other pranks on members of their family.

===Between the wars===
{{Quote|Now, behave, won't you? Won't you, Fred? And you, George?|Molly telling her sons to behave|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

By 1991, all her children from Bill to Fred and George had been accepted to Hogwarts and [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]], and Ron's first year at Hogwarts was to begin. Molly and Ginny accompanied Percy, Fred, George, and Ron to [[King's Cross Station]], although her daughter was too young to begin school herself. After Percy, Fred, and George got onto [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9&amp;frac34;]], [[Harry Potter|another young boy]] approached her and politely asked how to get onto the Platform. She kindly gave him instructions, and told him to go ahead before Ron.&lt;ref name="PS6"&gt;{{PS|B|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harry meeting the Weasleys..jpg|250px|thumb|Molly, Ginny, Ron, and [[Harry Potter]] meet for the first time at King's Cross Station]]

After getting onto the platform with Ginny, Molly learned that the boy she had just talked to was the famous Harry Potter. When Fred and George wondered if he remembered what [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] looked like, she became stern and forbade them from asking him. When last calls for the train came, Molly ushered her children onto the train and called for them to have a good term. She addressed the twins, telling them that she didn't want to receive any more owls sending the message that they had pulled any more of their trademark pranks, for example that they had blown up a toilet, and George quipped that they would send her a [[Hogwarts lavatory seat]].&lt;ref name="PS6"&gt;{{PS|B|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having become friends with Harry, Ron contacted Molly shortly before the Christmas holidays to tell her that Harry wasn't expecting any presents. She came to the rescue, knitting him an emerald green [[Weasley jumper]] and making him a box of home-made fudge.&lt;ref name="PS12"&gt;{{PS|B|12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Christmas holidays, Molly, Ginny, and Arthur also went to [[Romania]] to visit their son [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]].

When Harry and the others returned from Hogwarts for the summer, he thanked Molly for the jumper and fudge, to which she insisted it was no trouble. When Harry's [[Vernon Dursley|uncle Vernon]] barked at him to get moving, she tried to engage him in conversation, which ended up going nowhere.&lt;ref name="PS17"&gt;{{PS|B|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Summer of 1992====

{{Quote|Beds empty! No note! Car gone — could have crashed — out of my mind with worry — did you care? — never, as long as I've lived — you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from [[William Weasley|Bill]] or [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] or [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] —|Molly scolding her sons for worrying her|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

[[File:Weasley family breakfast.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Molly serving her family and Harry Potter breakfast after they stole the Ford Anglia]]

One night, Molly was scared to death when she found Fred, George, and Ron's beds empty, the [[Flying Ford Anglia|family car]] gone, and no note left behind explaining what the boys were doing. When the trio returned with Harry the next morning, having flown to [[4 Privet Drive|Surrey]] and back, her anger exploded and she yelled at them for what, to Harry, seemed like hours. She didn't blame Harry, but threw her sons nasty looks the whole time she made breakfast. To punish them, Molly made them de-[[gnome]] the back garden. When she looked up the process in ''[[Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to Household Pests]]'', Fred implied that his mother had a crush on Lockhart. While she said the thought was ridiculous, her body language told another story — she beamed at his picture and blushed slightly.&lt;ref name="COS3"&gt;{{COS|B|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as she was married, this may have just meant she admired Lockhart very greatly.

[[File:Diagonally.gif|250px|thumb|The Weasley family and Harry Potter travelling to Diagon Alley]]

About a week after Harry arrived at [[the Burrow]], Molly and Arthur took the family and Harry to [[Diagon Alley]] to buy their school supplies. Before leaving, she and Arthur learned that Harry had never travelled through the [[Floo Network]] before. After Harry got lost in [[Knockturn Alley]], she was relieved to find him safe with [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], being grateful to the half-giant for finding him. After getting their money from [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]], Molly departed with Ginny to a second-hand robe shop, to meet the others an hour later at [[Flourish and Blotts]]. After Arthur got into a [[Muggle duelling|fist fight]] with [[Lucius Malfoy]], she was livid, claiming that his actions were a bad example to set for their children.&lt;ref name="COS4"&gt;{{COS|B|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Chamber of Secrets====
{{Quote|— STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY’D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON’T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE — LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN’T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED — ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED — YOUR FATHER’S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT’S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME|Molly's howler expresses her furious anger towards Ron for his irresponsible actions|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

[[File:Ron Weasley's howler.gif|250px|thumb|left|Molly's Howler to Ron]]

After dropping the children off at King's Cross Station on 1 September, Molly and Arthur were outraged when they found their [[Flying Ford Anglia|car]] gone. That night, she received a letter from the head of Gryffindor [[Minerva McGonagall]] explaining what Harry and Ron had done. The next day, she sent a [[Howler]] to Ron, expressing her ''absolute'' disgust at his reckless behaviour and the fact that Arthur was now facing an inquiry at work.&lt;ref name="COS6"&gt;{{COS|B|6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1993, Molly and Arthur arrived at Hogwarts, who were extremely worried after learning that the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Monster of Slytherin]] had taken Ginny into the [[Chamber of Secrets]]. When Harry and Ron brought her back safely, she was grateful to Harry and curious as to how he managed it. After Harry explained everything, she accompanied Ginny to the hospital wing.&lt;ref name="COS18"&gt;{{COS|B|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sirius Black====
{{Quote|We tried to shut him in a pyramid. But Mum spotted us.|Fred and George referring to their time in Egypt|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}

[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|250px|thumb|The Weasley family in Egypt]]

That summer, Arthur won the annual ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' [[Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw|Grand Prize Galleon Draw]]. He and Molly decided to spend the gold on a trip to Egypt to visit Bill. While Bill took them on tours of the pyramids, she refused to let Ginny come into the last one, which was full of "mutant skeletons" of [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s who had broken in and "grown extra heads."&lt;ref name="POA1"&gt;{{POA|B|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning about a week before the new school year, Molly learnt from Arthur that [[Sirius Black]] had escaped from [[Azkaban]] Prison and that his target was supposedly Harry, as Sirius was muttering "he's at Hogwarts" in his sleep. She also heard from Arthur that the former prisoner intended to murder Harry.

[[File:Weasleys burrow.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Molly preparing her family for a trip to Diagon Alley]]

After meeting Harry in [[Diagon Alley]] on [[31 August]], Molly discussed Black's connection to Harry with Arthur, who wanted to tell Harry the truth about why Black was supposed to be after him. She didn't want to send Harry to school with that hanging over his head, while being convinced that he would be perfectly safe from harm since [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] was stationed at Hogwarts. Arthur then countered that if Black could break ''out'' of Azkaban, then he was capable of breaking ''in'' to Hogwarts.&lt;ref name="POA4"&gt;{{POA|B|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Molly and Arthur saw Harry, Ron, [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and the others off to school. The following June, she arrived at [[King's Cross Station|King's Cross]] to pick her family up.&lt;ref name="POA5"&gt;{{POA|B|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reappearance of the Dark Mark====
{{Quote|What have they [Fred and George] done this time? If it's got anything to do with Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes...|Molly's dislike of [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasley's Wizard Wheezes]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

In August, Molly sent a letter to the Dursleys by the Muggle postman, "asking" permission to take Harry to the [[Quidditch World Cup]], though the Weasleys were planning to collect Harry whether the Dursleys said yes or not. Unsure of how much postage to include, she completely covered the envelope with stamps, leaving only a square inch on the front in which she managed to squeeze the Dursleys' address.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

[[File:Playing in the garden at the Burrow.png|250px|thumb|Molly's children, [[Harry Potter]], and [[Hermione Granger]] in the garden of the Burrow]]

When she entered the family's kitchen, Molly caught Arthur in the middle of scolding Fred and George for something. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny disappeared upstairs while Arthur was forced to tell her about the [[Ton-Tongue Toffee]] the twins had pulled on Harry's cousin [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]. After she stopped yelling at them, she began preparing dinner, during which she huffed about George and Fred's trouble-making.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

On the morning of the [[Quidditch World Cup]], Molly caught Fred and George trying to smuggle Ton-Tongue Toffees out of the house, in unusual places like the lining of George's jacket and the turn-ups of Fred's jeans. When she read about the [[Death Eaters]]' attack on the World Cup grounds, Molly became worried for her family. When the family arrived safely back home, she hugged Fred and George, crying over the thought of the fact that ''if'' they had died, the last thing she spoke to them about would be that she yelled at them for not having earned more [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]].&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

====Triwizard Tournament====
{{Quote|Surprise! Thought we'd come and watch you. Harry!|Molly visiting Hogwarts to watch the Third Task|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:PM molly harrygoodbyes.png|250px|thumb|left|Molly seeing her children, Harry, and Hermione off to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]]]
On [[1 September]], Molly, Bill, and Charlie accompanied the [[trio]] to King's Cross Station for the return to Hogwarts, wishing all of them a happy term and gave hugs goodbye. The three of them all implied that [[Triwizard Tournament|something special]] was happening at the school, but wouldn't elaborate. This left the trio and others highly curious as to what it could possibly be, but they didn't find out until the term started what the surprise was.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

According to Charlie, when Harry's name came out of the [[Goblet of Fire]] as a surprise fourth champion, Molly was against letting him compete, believing that Harry was too young. She was "in floods" after reading an "interview" with [[Rita Skeeter]] in which Skeeter claimed Harry still cried about his parents, as she happened to believe every word that [[Rita Skeeter]] penned and felt bad for Harry. Considering his mother's already fragile state, Charlie didn't have the heart to tell her what Harry had to do for the [[Triwizard Tournament#The First Task|First Task]].&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

Molly was horrified when Skeeter reported that [[Hermione Granger]] was messing with Harry. As a result, on Easter she sent Hermione chicken-sized Easter eggs containing homemade [[toffee]], whereas the ones she sent to Harry and Ron were the size of dragon eggs.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

[[File:Third task onlookers.jpg|250px|thumb|Molly among the people watching the third task of the tournament]]
In June, Molly arrived at Hogwarts with Bill to watch Harry in the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, in place of his family. While whittling down the hours until the task started, Harry gave her and Bill a tour around the grounds, showing them the [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] carriage and the [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]] ship. Molly was intrigued by the [[Whomping Willow]], which had been planted after she left school. She also reminisced about [[Ogg]], the gamekeeper before Hagrid.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

When the trio returned to the castle for lunch, Ron was surprised to see his mother and eldest brother there. Fred, George, and Ginny came over to join them, something which Harry enjoyed. When Hermione appeared at the table, having come from the library, she greeted her more stiffly than usual, as Skeeter had been writing articles about the prodigy student supposedly toying with Harry and [[Viktor Krum]]'s affections. After Harry explained that the stories were false and that he and Hermione had never been romantically involved, she warmed up to her son's friend once again. Molly later defended Harry with a fierce passion against [[Amos Diggory]]'s accusations of not correcting Rita Skeeter in her original article about Harry, which was supposed to be about the Triwizard Tournament.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

[[File:B4C36M1 Snape Dark Mark reveal.png|250px|thumb|left|Snape using his Dark Mark as proof that Voldemort had returned]]
After Harry returned from [[Little Hangleton]] with [[Cedric Diggory]]'s dead body, Molly, the other Weasleys, and Hermione stayed with him in the hospital wing. When Dumbledore acted to reactivate the Order of the Phoenix, Molly was shocked to learn Sirius Black was in the room, still believing Sirius to be a mass murderer like most of the wizarding world. However, Ron was able to convince her otherwise. Molly and the other members learnt about Lord Voldemort's return, which she believed Harry about. She also comforted Harry after his horrific experience in the Little Hangleton graveyard.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

===Second Wizarding War===
A week into the summer holidays, Molly had her heart broken when [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] broke contact with the family after a row with [[Arthur Weasley|his father]]. Percy insulted his parents, believing them to be "idiots" for following Dumbledore, and moved out to [[Percy Weasley's London residence|a flat in London]].&lt;ref name="OOTP"&gt;{{OOTP}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went to London to try and talk with Percy, but he simply slammed the door in her face.

====Living at 12 Grimmauld Place====
{{Dialogue a-b|Molly|I don't believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!|George Weasley|What are Fred and I, next door neighbours?|Conversation after Ron was made a prefect|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Dinner at 12 Grimmauld Place.jpg|250px|thumb|Molly having a row with Sirius involving Harry's welfare]]
Molly and Arthur moved their family to 12 Grimmauld Place in [[London]], the headquarters of the [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]]. Under Dumbledore's orders, the Weasleys kept Harry Potter in the dark about the Order's goings-on. When the [[Advance Guard]] delivered Harry to Grimmauld Place, she was pleased to see him, but quickly ushered him upstairs so he wouldn't interrupt the Order's meeting. When the meeting ended, Molly brought the children downstairs for dinner. Against her wishes, Sirius and Remus gave Harry the general picture of what the Order was doing in the fight against Voldemort, which lead to an intense row between Molly and Sirius involving Harry's welfare.

[[File:Doxycide Grimmauld Place.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Molly with others in [[12 Grimmauld Place]] preparing to clean]]
For the following weeks, Molly led the charge in making the house suitable for living in, which was not an easy task considering how long it had been without inhabitants or proper housekeeping.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; When Harry had to go to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] for a hearing regarding his illegal use of under-age magic, Molly was among those who worried about the result. Like the rest of the family, she was relieved when Harry was cleared of all charges, although she did scold Fred, George, and Ginny for parading around chanting "He got off."

When Ron was made a Gryffindor [[prefect]], Molly was overjoyed and offered to get him a reward, to which he asked for a new broom, but quickly added that it didn't need to be a ''good'' broom upon seeing his mother's face fall. She returned later that night with the children's school supplies and prepared a party to celebrate Ron and Hermione's appointments. When [[Alastor Moody|"Mad-Eye" Moody]] arrived, Molly asked him to look at what was in the writing desk in the drawing room. Using his "mad" eye, Moody confirmed it was a [[Boggart]] and offered to get rid of it, but she declined, commenting she would do it after dinner. 

After Harry witnessed her inability to vanquish it, she tearfully expressed her concern over her family's safety. Lupin comforted her, explaining that the Order had a better understanding of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] than they did the first time, and that while he couldn't promise no one would get hurt, the Order would do their best to protect her family and Harry from the upcoming danger.&lt;ref name="OOTP9" /&gt;

[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-3015.jpg|250px|thumb|Molly escorting [[Harry Potter]] and her children to the Hogwarts Express]]
On the morning of 1 September, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] again got on Molly's nerves when they bewitched their trunks to zoom down the stairs, to save the trouble of carrying them. The trunks managed to knock Ginny down two flights of stairs, to which her mother screamed at the pair that they could have seriously injured her. When Sirius came bounding downstairs in his dog form to see Harry off, Molly reiterated that it was a bad idea, but felt that it was up to him if he wanted to risk his safety.

When she got wind of the [[Dumbledore's Army|secret group]] Harry, Ron, and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] were planning to form in order to teach practical [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|defensive magic]], Molly was firmly against the idea, believing that they would all have time to learn to defend themselves after they left school. She asked Sirius to pass on a message to Ron, which was that he was in no way to continue the group. She also wanted the message passed on to Harry and Hermione, due to accepting that she had no control over the pair's actions, but having their best interests at heart.

====St Mungo's Hospital====
{{Quote|I don't know what would have happened if it hadn't been for you, Harry... They might not have found Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you he's alive and Dumbledore's been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was, you've no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise, look at poor [[Sturgis Podmore|Sturgis]]...|Molly thanking Harry for saving [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]]'s life|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix }}

During the Christmas holiday, Molly was contacted by Dumbledore's phoenix [[Fawkes]] to warn her that Arthur had been attacked by [[Nagini]] while doing guard duty for the Order. While the Weasley children stayed with Sirius in [[Grimmauld Place]], they wanted to set off for St Mungo's at once. In response, Sirius had to convince them they couldn't until their mother had been notified, as it would look too suspicious otherwise. This caused issues with Fred and George whom wanted to see their father immediately.  

Before setting off for [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], Molly sent a note to Grimmauld Place, which stated that Arthur was still alive and warned them to stay put. At 5:10 a.m.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; she arrived at Grimmauld Place to tell them Arthur would be all right and that they could all visit him later, making George and Ginny very relieved before they got up and hugged her. When Sirius began making breakfast, Molly hugged Harry and expressed her gratitude that if not for him Arthur might have died. She proceeded to tell Sirius to go and relax and that she would take over breakfast. 

[[File:Weasley christmas.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Molly with Arthur after he was attacked by Nagini during Christmas holidays]]

When the Weasleys and Harry visited Arthur in St Mungo's, Molly became alarmed when Arthur mentioned one of his room-mates was a [[werewolf]], but he calmed her by pointing out the full moon wasn't for another fortnight. When the twins tried to get information from Arthur about what he had been doing, she got angry and told them that the topic wasn't up for discussion. Molly later fretted over Harry's supposed illness when he was acting strangely after their visit. In fact, Harry was concerned and scared for the well-being of others because he thought he might have been possessed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], but she did not know this.

On [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], Molly's concern about Percy reached a breaking point when he returned his Christmas jumper unopened. Fred and George "attempted" to console her, but soon afterwards Lupin took over. When the family and Harry returned to visit Arthur again, Molly exploded after learning that for his wound, Arthur had tried using [[stitches]], a Muggle remedy for similar Muggle wounds.

====Start of open warfare====

[[File:Burrow summer 1996.jpg|250px|thumb|Molly greeting Harry in the Burrow's kitchen during the summer holiday]]

In June, Molly and Arthur arrived at King's Cross Station to pick their children up. The couple also made plans with Dumbledore to take Harry to [[The Burrow]] two weeks into the summer holidays, so he wouldn't have to spend the whole summer with the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]], probably guessing that Harry didn't want to spend his entire summer holidays grieving his godfather's death at [[Privet Drive]] alone, with only his negative thoughts and unpleasant relatives for company.

When Harry arrived in July, Molly revealed that Arthur had been promoted to head a [[Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects|new department]] for [[Rufus Scrimgeour]]. From the tone of her voice, Harry deduced she had been "bursting" to tell someone. She made him a bowl of onion soup and remarked on how much he had grown since she saw him last, stating that it looked as though he had a [[Stretching Jinx]] placed upon him. Molly and Harry then discussed [[Horace Slughorn]] and his return to Hogwarts. When Arthur arrived home from work, he made her ask him their security questions before allowing himself in, as to set an example and in the process revealed that Arthur's private nickname for her was "Mollywobbles."

[[File:Tonks Molly Arthur Lupin.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Molly, Arthur, Remus, and Tonks at the Burrow]]

The next morning, Molly expressed her disdain at Bill's engagement to [[Fleur Delacour]], whom was staying at the house as Bill had brought her to the Burrow so she could get to know his family better before the wedding. Molly had a low opinion of Fleur and disliked being alone with her, thinking that she was snobbish and rude. She also felt that the engagement was rushed and believed it was due to the fear brought on by Voldemort's return to power. According to Ginny, her mother kept trying to break up the engagement by inviting [[Nymphadora Tonks]] to dinner, hoping that Bill would fall for her instead.

When Hermione got a black eye from one of Fred and George's [[Boxing telescope|punching telescopes]], she went to Molly to try and get rid of it to no avail; but she was unable to remove the bruise even with ''[[The Healer's Helpmate]]''. When Ron's [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] results arrived, Molly was pleased to learn he had earned seven "pass" grades, commenting that it was more than Fred and George both earned, put together. When the school book lists arrived, she refused to go to [[Diagon Alley]] without Arthur; when Ron made a joke about Voldemort possibly hiding in [[Flourish and Blotts]], his mother threatened not only to leave him behind and get his things herself, but hold him back from returning to Hogwarts too, so Ron quickly recanted as he wanted to see [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Fred and George's shop]].

[[File:B6C6M1 inside Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.jpg|250px|thumb|Molly with the trio and Ginny in [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]]]]

When the family and Hagrid arrived in [[Diagon Alley]], Molly expressed her concern to stay together, while at the same time battling the desire to finish the shopping quickly. Hagrid assured her that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would be fine with him, so she, Arthur, and Ginny headed off towards [[Flourish and Blotts]]. When the group reunited, they headed off towards [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]]. Approaching the store, Molly stared in horror at the advertisement for "U-No-Poo," an item they sold to help cause constipation. Once inside the store, Ginny asked her mother if she could buy a [[Pygmy Puff]]. At one point, she also caught Ron in the middle of making an extremely rude hand gesture at Fred and immediately threatened to [[jinx]] his fingers together if she saw him do it again.

On 1 September, Molly and Arthur ushered the children onto the train back to Hogwarts.

====1996 [[Christmas holidays]]====

[[File:Wealey Chirstmas 1996.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Molly with her family during Christmas holiday]]

During the Christmas holidays, Molly had her hands full, as she entertained many quests that Christmas, some including Harry, Fleur, and Remus. She masked [[Percy Weasley|Percy]]'s continued defection from the family by saying he was busy at the Ministry. When [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] brought Percy over in an excuse to speak to [[Harry Potter|Harry]], the others present tensed at the mention of Scrimgeour wanting to get Harry alone but Molly paid no regard to this, as her main focus was Percy, which was made evident by her overjoyingly crying tears of happiness and hugging her son. 

However, Percy had no intention of speaking with his family, so his mother was more devastated than ever when Percy stormed out after having mashed parsnips flung at his glasses by [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], [[George Weasley|George]], and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. She continued to be upset well past Christmas, teary eyed and sobbing when she saw her children and Harry off to Hogwarts via the [[Floo]], bidding them farewell and had them promise to try and be careful, which resulted in her being in slightly higher spirits by the end of the goodbyes.

In March, Molly and Arthur were called to the school when Ron accidentally drank some [[poison]]ed [[mead]]. Harry saved his life by the use of a [[bezoar]], a small stone found in the stomach of a [[goat]] that acts as an [[antidote]] to most poisons. When the pair arrived in the hospital wing, she hugged Harry very tightly, pointing out how many of the family members he had saved. She was very happy that Ron was no longer in danger and would make a full recovery.

[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|The funeral of Albus Dumbledore that Molly attended along with her husband]]
Molly and Arthur returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] again in June after learning that Bill had been injured in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]. While Arthur was interested in how Dumbledore had died, she only had her eyes on Bill. She commented that Bill had always been handsome and that he was "going" to be married, but [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] took offence to this and shouted that she didn't care what Bill looked like, as her love for him ran deeper than physical appearance. Accepting that the pair truly did love each other, she offered Fleur her [[Muriel|great-aunt Muriel]]'s goblin-made tiara to wear at the wedding, and then the two women hugged, which was surprising as Molly had always disagreed with Fleur and Bill's relationship.

In June, Molly and Arthur attended [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's funeral]] along with Bill and Fleur. They were deeply saddened by the tragic death of the Headmaster of Hogwarts, who protected their family members and their comrades in the Order. At some point, Molly learned that Harry, Ron, and Hermione were planning to drop out of Hogwarts. When she approached them to find out why, they refused to divulge any information. While Arthur and Remus also approached the issue and dropped it when they were told it was a secret, she was determined to learn the truth.

====[[Battle of the Seven Potters]]====
{{Quote|Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?|Molly asking Harry Potter about the whereabouts of the others|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Ginny and Molly at the Burrow.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Molly and Ginny relieved at the safe arrival of Harry and Hagrid]]
When Harry and Hagrid arrived at the [[the Burrow|Burrow]] after the Battle of the Seven Potters, Molly was relieved that they managed to arrive safely. She hurried from the inside of the Burrow and proceeded to pull Harry into a hug that he felt he didn't deserve. She was worried because a lot of the others had missed their [[portkey]]s and Harry and Hagrid were the first to arrive, even thought they were suppose to arrive third. [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] then asked if Molly had any brandy, for "medicinal purposes", as he was in pain from the battle. Instead of [[Summoning Charm|summoning]] it by magic, she went into the house to collect it herself. Harry knew that this was because she wanted to hide her worry and the blotchiness of her face.

[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows molly george.jpg|250px|thumb|Molly taking care of an injured [[George Weasley|George]] after he lost an ear]]
A few moments later, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] alerted Molly to the arrival of [[Remus Lupin|Lupin]] and George. Seeing there was obviously something wrong with her son, she soon learned that he was missing his left ear. Molly managed to [[Healing magic|staunch the bleeding]], but was unable to repair the damage. However, she was simply relieved that he was alive. When [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] returned safely, Molly cried harder than ever when George turned the injury into a punch line. George then commented that at least from then on, she would be able to differentiate the pair. A few minutes later, Ron and Bill both returned safely. Hugging his mother, Bill told the group that "Mad-Eye" Moody had been killed.

====The wedding of Bill &amp; Fleur====

We are.|And may I ask ''why'' you are abandoning your education?|Molly questioning Harry on the trio's reasons for dropping out of school|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:WB F6 MollyWeasleyLeaningOnStaircase HP6D-04638.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Molly preparing the Burrow for the arrival of the [[Delacour family|Delacours]]]]
Within a few days, Molly approached [[Harry Potter|Harry]] under the pretence of determining the owner of a sock, about why he, Ron, and Hermione were planning to leave Hogwarts. Harry refused to say explicitly why, but dropped hints that it was because of something [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] wanted him to do. She argued that she and Arthur deserved to know, and was sure [[Hermione Granger's father|Mr]]. and [[Hermione Granger's mother|Mrs Granger]] would agree, continuing that Dumbledore had the whole Order at his command if he wanted something done and the three of them were hardly of age. Harry countered that there had been no misunderstanding: the mission Dumbledore left for him was for him alone, and Ron and Hermione were coming along by choice.  

Seeing she was fighting a losing battle, Molly the changed the subject by asking if he would help prepare the house for Bill and Fleur's wedding. He agreed, but she made sure to give the trio jobs that kept them away from each other, believing that she could delay their departure if she could prevent them from getting together and planning, as [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] commented to Harry. When the [[Delacour family|Delacours]] arrived the following morning, Molly was somewhat flustered, but pleased to have them there. She and Arthur fervently insisted that Monsieur and Madame Delacour take their bedroom, while she and Arthur slept in the sitting room. 

[[File:Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour.jpg|250px|thumb|Bill and Fleur's wedding]]
The following day, which was also Harry's birthday, Molly gave him [[Fabian Prewett's watch|a watch]] that had belonged to her late brother Fabian. In the middle of explaining the tradition of giving children a watch when they came of age, her speech was interrupted by a hug from Harry with which he hoped to convey his deep feelings of gratitude and care, which worked as she was taken-aback but very touched. When Charlie arrived that evening, she forced him into a chair at wandpoint and gave him a haircut. Molly then made a scrumptious dinner and made Harry's birthday cake into the shape of a [[Golden Snitch]]. Just before the cutting of the cake, she learned that Rufus Scrimgeour was accompanying Arthur home. After the pair arrived, Scrimgeour revealed the reason for his visit: he required a private word with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 

[[File:Harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-i-20100922043334092.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Kingsley's Patronus warning the wedding attendees of the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|Ministry's fall]]]]
The next day was [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|Bill's wedding to Fleur]]. Molly was once again in tears as Percy didn't show up. During the ceremony, she sat with [[Apolline Delacour]] and the pair cried into their tissues. At the reception that followed, she danced with Monsieur Delacour. Soon afterwards, Molly learned with everyone else that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] had fallen to the Death Eaters' control and that Scrimgeour was dead, shortly before the reception was ransacked by arriving Death Eaters. After the Death Eaters left, she and Arthur sent word to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that the rest of the family was safe.

In March, the [[Death Eaters]] identified Ron as travelling with Harry Potter. Bill was able to get word to his family, and Molly and the rest of the Weasley family vacated the Burrow. They lived with her aunt [[Muriel]] during this time.

====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
{{Dialogue a-b|Bellatrix Lestrange|What will happen to your children when I've killed you? When Mummy's gone the same way as Freddie?|Molly|You — will — never — touch — our — children — again!|A fierce duel between Molly and Bellatrix|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Battle of hogearts- statues.gif|250px|thumb|[[Minerva McGonagall]] and Molly preparing for battle]]

On 2 May, 1998 Molly and Arthur arrived at the school to take part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Along with several other individuals, she cast [[Protego Maxima|protective charms]] over Hogwarts before the battle. As the combination of the Order and [[Dumbledore's Army]] left to gather in the [[Great Hall]], she was adamant about Ginny going home since she was under-age. Ginny insisted she should be there in addition to the rest of her family and because she was a member of Dumbledore's Army. During this argument, Percy entered the room, having learned of the pending battle from [[Aberforth Dumbledore]]. He made peace with his family, much to her relief.

When the family left to join the others, Molly caught Ginny trying to sneak out with them. Lupin then proposed that Ginny could stay in the [[Room of Requirement]]; that way she could remain close to her family while simultaneously being out of harm's way. During a break in the battle, as ordered by Voldemort, Molly grieved Fred's death in the Great Hall. She laid across his chest and wept, while Arthur stroked her hair.[[File:Molly cursing Bellatrix.gif|245x245px|thumb|left|Molly duelling Bellatrix Lestrange during the second half of the final battle]]
When the battle resumed, Molly witnessed [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] fire a [[Killing Curse]] at Ginny, who was fighting along with Hermione and [[Luna Lovegood]]. Distraught at the prospect of losing yet another child as well as her only daughter, she angrily charged right at the infamous Death Eater who at first was beside herself with laughter at the idea of Molly  attempting to fight her but soon became enraged as she bore witness to Molly's fierce assault. Both witches began to battle with such lethal ferocity that the "''floor beneath them turned hot and cracked''".     

As Molly continued her attack, Bellatrix taunted her, asking what would happen to her children when she died. Molly vowed that Bellatrix would never inflict harm on her family again and struck the arrogantly distracted Bellatrix with a deadly blow.&lt;ref name="DH36"&gt;{{DH|B|36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, she avenged [[Alice and Frank Longbottom|Frank and Alice Longbottom]], [[Sirius Black]], and [[Nymphadora Tonks]], among countless others.   

[[File:Weasleys after battle.jpg|251x251px|thumb|Molly with her family after the Battle]]

The death of his "''last, best lieutenant''" made [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] turn his wand on Molly, but Harry shielded her and revealed himself to be alive. She and everyone else watched the interaction between Harry and Voldemort, which ended with Voldemort's final defeat and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Molly joined the other Weasleys in congratulating Harry. She was last seen sitting with Ginny (who had her head on her mother's shoulder) and her other family members at a table in the [[Great Hall]].&lt;ref name="DH36"&gt;{{DH|B|36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
In the years following Voldemort's death, Molly's family grew with the marriages of her children and births of numerous grandchildren. She also served as the namesake of [[Molly Weasley II|Percy's oldest daughter]].

==Physical appearance==
Molly was frequently described as a short, slightly plump, and kindly-looking woman. Like the rest of her immediate family, she had flaming fiery red hair and her eyes were the same shade of warm brown as her daughter's. Harry was shocked to see that she could so easily look "like a sabre-tooth tiger" when she was angry with her sons. 

Molly was described as "porky" by [[Draco Malfoy]]&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; and "dumpy" by [[Vernon Dursley]] (despite the fact that Vernon and his [[Dudley Dursley|son]] were much larger than her).&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; Between June and August of 1995, she lost a good deal of weight and appeared paler, though she seemed to get a healthier look back by the next year.

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b-c-a-b|Hermione Granger|If you don't stop, I'm going to —|Fred Weasley|Put us in detention?|George Weasley|Make us write lines?|No, but I will write to your mother.|You wouldn't.|Hermione making the one threat that could scare Fred and George|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:WB F5 MollyWeasleyGrimmauldPlace CupsHarrysFaceInHands HP5D-10744.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Molly's motherly affection towards Harry Potter]]
Molly was a kind-hearted, gentle, loving, and very motherly woman. It was comfortable for almost everyone to be around such a sympathetic and warm person. Being in the same room with her was very reassuring. Appalled at the mistreatment that Harry suffered at the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]], Molly was delighted to have [[Harry Potter|Harry]] stay with the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]] at [[The Burrow]], where she could offer food, advice, and general mothering. Starved for affection from his own aunt [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]], Harry found warmth from Molly, who considered to be his closest mother figure. Molly was also very protective of her children as well, although (especially in Fred and George's case) she could become very annoyed with their antics.  

Molly could have even her twin sons cowering before her if she was angry enough. She was fiercely proud of her children's accomplishments, but was also scandalised by their misbehaviour, being particularly frustrated for the twins' antics. She wasn't above of sending a [[Howler]] to the school to humiliate one of them publicly for stepping out of line, as evidenced by her reaction to the use of the unauthorised [[Flying Ford Anglia]] by [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] to reach [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] at his second school year. Ironically, it was high achiever [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] who caused her the most pain, breaking with the family for their unwavering allegiance to [[Albus Dumbledore]].  

Harry occasionally found Molly's over-protectiveness somewhat smothering. Along with her eldest son [[William Weasley|Bill]], she came to watch Harry in the [[Triwizard Tournament]] and after his ordeal in the graveyard, visited him in Hogwarts' hospital wing, where she hugs him 'how Harry imagined a mother would'. However, Molly sometimes found it difficult to cope with her children heading out in their own, separate directions. Not surprisingly, she considered [[Fleur Delacour]] wrong for Bill when they became engaged until the former showed her true feelings.       

When Harry asked about what the [[Order of the Phoenix]] was doing against [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], she continually insisted he shouldn't be told more than he needed to know under Dumbledore's orders. However, his godfather [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] believed that he had to dealt with more than the Order could imagine and thus deserved to have the whole picture. Though Harry was touched by Molly's actions, he felt Sirius was right in that he wasn't a small child and should be treated as a maturing adult, something which she understood but still worried about.

==Magical abilities and skills==

[[File:Download (5).gif|250px|thumb|Molly slaying [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]]]
*'''[[Love]]''': Molly was a very loving person and the epitome of a good mother, loving all her children dearly and often came to regard close friends as family too. She grew so fond of [[Harry Potter]] that her [[Boggart]] changed accordingly to include his dead body along with her family.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; Motivated by her love for her family, Molly bravely took on [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and killed her to defend her daughter [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]].&lt;ref name="DH36" /&gt;
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': During the Battle of Hogwarts, Molly could cast spells without saying them verbally while she duelled. Since non-verbal magic is very difficult, this testifies that she was actually a powerful witch in her own right.&lt;ref name="DH36" /&gt;
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Molly was shown to be a surprisingly skilful and even lethal [[duelling|duellist]], especially when her family was threatened. In [[1998]], she took part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] where she single-handedly killed Bellatrix, a dangerous member of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters|followers]], after the Death Eater had nearly killed her [[Ginevra Weasley|daughter]].&lt;ref name="DH36"&gt;{{DH|B|36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Charm]]s''': Molly was shown to have been very talented in this field of [[magic]]. Before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], she was one of the individuals who cast the many powerful protective enchantments — such as ''[[Protego Maxima]]'' — over the school. She could also produce a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]],&lt;ref name="LEGOY1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LEGOY2" /&gt; a mark of her superior [[magic]]al ability given its immense difficulty. Molly was highly skilled in [[food-related charms]], to the point where her son [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] was under the impression she could create good food from nothing. However, it was clear that she used magic to make the food she cooked even tastier, as [[Harry Potter]] considered her the best cook he knew.&lt;ref name="HBP4"&gt;{{HBP|B|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also capable of casting a powerful [[Imperturbable Charm]].&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;
{{Quote|Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.|Molly slaying Bellatrix Lestrange with a lethal curse|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Molly was normally a good-natured woman who did not actively practise dark magic, but she was actually capable of casting [[Dark charm]]s with lethal effect. During her duel against Bellatrix, she effectively cast a wide variety of [[curse]]s and ultimately killed her opponent with a [[Molly Weasley's curse|curse]] that struck her over her heart.&lt;ref name="DH36" /&gt; She also confidently threatened to either [[jinx]] or [[hex]] Ron, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], and [[George Weasley|George]] on numerous occasions. The fact that none of them seemed to cross her when she issues this threat could be a testament to her talent.
*'''[[Healing magic|Healing]]''': Molly was a competent healer, as shown by how she was able to treat George's injuries despite his having lost a lot of [[blood]] after the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]]. However, she was unable to regrow his lost ear, as it was caused by the ''[[Sectumsempra]]'' [[curse]].&lt;ref name="DH5"&gt;{{DH|B|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also owned a copy of ''[[The Healer's Helpmate]]'', a book that would have helped her understand and perform medical magic.
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Molly had effectively brewed a [[Love Potion]] in her youth.&lt;ref name="POA5"&gt;{{POA|B|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level potion, implying Molly was highly proficient in potion-making, capable of making advanced brews.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Molly was capable of performing [[Conjuration]], a very advanced and difficult branch of transfiguration, as she was able to effectively [[Sauce-making spell|conjure sauce]] from her wand whilst cooking food.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most adult wizards, Molly was capable of apparating successfully at will.&lt;ref name="GOF11"&gt;{{GOF|B|11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molly Weasley wand.png|150px|thumb|Molly's wand]]
*'''[[Molly Weasley's wand|Wand]]''': Molly owned a [[wand]] of which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[wand core]]. She famously used her wand to strike down and kill [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].
*'''[[Weasley Clock|Family clock]]''': This clock showed where every member of her family was.
*'''[[The clock at The Burrow|Kitchen clock]]''': Her family owned a clock which didn't tell the [[time]] but showed options of activities to be completed in time, such as time to make tea, feed the chickens etc.
*'''A copy of ''[[The Healer's Helpmate]]''''': Molly owned this book, which covered magical remedies to common injuries.[[File:OneMinuteFeastsItsMagic.png|150px|thumb|''One Minute Feasts - It's Magic!'']]
*''[[One Minute Feasts - It's Magic!|'''One Minute Feasts - It's Magic!''']]'': The Burrow contained a copy of this book, most likely used by Mrs Weasley to aid in her cooking.
*'''''[[Enchantment in Baking]]''''': The Burrow contained a copy of this book, most likely used by Mrs Weasley to aid in her cooking.

==Relationships==
===Family===
====Prewett family====
[[File:Prewett pm.jpg|left|thumb|240x240px|[[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], Molly's late brothers]]
Molly was born into the [[Prewett family]]. Her relationship with her [[Molly Weasley's mother|mother]] and [[Molly Weasley's father|father]] is unknown, but it is possible that, like the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], the Prewetts didn't buy into values of pure-blood supremacy held by so many other wizarding pure blood families, as Molly had these same views.

Her brothers, [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], were both members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[First Wizarding War]], but were brutally killed by five [[Death Eaters]]. It is likely that Molly was close to her brothers, as she kept Fabian's watch until she gave it to [[Harry Potter]] for his seventeenth birthday. Their deaths influenced her later protectiveness of her family during the Second Wizarding War.

Molly was close to her other family members as well; her uncle, [[Ignatius Prewett]]'s first name became her son Percy's middle name, and aunt by marriage [[Lucretia Black|Lucretia Prewett]] (née [[House of Black|Black]]). Her irritable great-aunt [[Muriel]] was still alive in the 1990s and associated with her family.

====Weasley family====
{{Quote|FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE! THERE WAS NO NEED — I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS — JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!|Molly berating the twins over their incessant [[magic]] usage|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|240x240px|thumb|The Weasley family on holiday in Egypt|alt=]]

Molly was very close with her husband, whom she was deeply in love with, and seemed to get along well with his family. She pampered her seven children as much as she could afford to, making up for the lack of funds for new books, brooms and robes by showering her loved ones with affection and providing them with abundant and delicious home-cooking and handmade gifts. However, Molly had no qualms about speaking her mind and enforcing discipline when her children put a "toe out of line"; the only thing [[Hermione Granger]] could do to stop [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] testing their [[Skiving Snackbox]]es on first years prior to their departure from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] was threaten to write to their mother, something which genuinely scared them. 

She constantly tried to pressure [[William Weasley|Bill]] into cutting his hair and not dressing as flashily as he liked to. Molly had a strong desire for her children to work at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] like their father, causing her to scold Fred and George on numerous occasions for their dream of managing a joke shop. In the end, she clearly wanted her children to be happy in their careers, being impressed when Fred and George proved to be skilled businessmen.&lt;ref name="HBP5"&gt;{{HBP|B|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Order-of-the-phoenix-arthur molly.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Molly's and Arthur's affection and love for each other|alt=|left]]

Though she was frequently exasperated with her husband's quirky fascination with [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] artefacts and his seeming inability to act as a firm disciplinarian when it came to many of their sons' shenanigans, Molly clearly loved [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] dearly and was fiercely proud of all he had accomplished in his career.&lt;ref name="HBP5"&gt;{{HBP|B|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molly's love and sense of protection for her family - especially the youngest members - was apparent in the form her boggart took: Her greatest fear was her family, including Harry, lying dead on the floor. Her fear of seeing her family dead was partially realised when Fred was killed during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], especially since one of the forms that her boggart took was the dead bodies of the twins. 

Molly loved all of her children, but she seemed especially fond of her youngest child and only daughter, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], whom she passed most moments with. When she saw Ginny being fought by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], the mere possibility of losing her only daughter was enough to make her openly challenge and kill the most dangerous Dark witch of that age. Also, Molly was notable for extending her familial affections to those who weren't related to her, including [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]]'s best friends.

Molly was heartbroken when the "high achiever", [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], turned his back on his family in favour of pursuing his career at the Ministry. She tried to get him to return several times but to no avail, often crying over his departure and continued to send him gifts like her hand-knitted Christmas jumpers, which he would coldly return without a note. Despite his aloof departure, Molly remained affectionate towards her third son, using his good behaviour as reference when scolding the twins for overusing their magic for the simplest matter and masking his defection by making excuses for him such as being too busy at the Ministry to return home for Christmas. After Percy apologised to the whole family, Molly was not shown to have any problems in forgiving him.

After the [[Second Wizarding War]], Molly's family expanded even further, having many grandchildren through her sons and daughter: [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]] and [[Louis Weasley|Louis]], Bill and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s children; [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]] (who was named after her) and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]], Percy and [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey's]] daughters; [[Fred Weasley II|Fred]] and [[Roxanne Weasley|Roxanne]], George and [[Angelina Johnson]]'s children; [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]], Ron and Hermione's children; and [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]], Ginny and Harry's children. Based on her affection for her family, it is likely that Molly was a devoted grandmother.

====Harry Potter====
{{Quote|Oh, Harry, it’s lovely to see you! You’re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you’ll have to wait a bit for dinner, I’m afraid....|Molly's concern for Harry's wellbeing|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Harry Potter.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]], her future son-in-law]]
Molly first met Harry while taking her sons to the [[Hogwarts Express]]. She took pity on him for being alone, as he seemed to be a sweet and polite boy. Upon being told by Fred and George who he was, Molly was adamant that her children not pester Harry about his past, stating that he would probably get enough attention and instructing them not to add to it. After getting to know more about Harry through Ron, Molly began treating him as another member of the family, whether it be by letting him stay at [[the Burrow]] for the school holidays or fussing over the state of his health and making sure he had additional helpings during meals, although she tended to avoid the subject of the Dursleys when Harry brought them up even briefly. 

She also sent Harry a [[Weasley jumper]] and a large box of fudge or mince pies every [[Christmas]], even after the two of them had only spoken briefly at King's Cross during Harry's first year, simply because Ron had mentioned that Harry wasn't expecting any presents.

Molly would occasionally forget she wasn't Harry's mother and tended to be as protective of him as if he was one of her own children, a sentiment Harry himself shared. She was deeply affected when Harry was forced to compete in the [[Triwizard Tournament]], to the point that her attitude towards Hermione temporarily became almost hostile because she assumed [[Rita Skeeter]]'s claims that Hermione was toying with Harry's emotions until Harry himself assured her otherwise. 

[[File:Molly hugging Harry.gif|250px|thumb|Molly greeting Harry, whom she viewed as another son|left]]
Molly pushed particularly hard for Harry not to be "burdened" with the knowledge of certain aspects of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]'s business involving [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], which caused her to come into conflict with Harry's godfather, [[Sirius Black]] and even her own husband. She showed her over-protective nature again upon discovering that Harry, Ron, and Hermione weren't intending to return to Hogwarts during their [[seventh year|final year]], demanding to be informed of their intentions and even did everything in her power to prevent them having any opportunity to discuss their plans in secret. 

The form of Molly's [[Boggart]], which reflected her greatest fear of seeing her family dead by appearing as their dead bodies, included Harry's own corpse. In return, Harry was grateful to her for the love and protection he needed and wanted. After Molly killed Bellatrix, Voldemort prepared to attack her in revenge, prompting Harry to reveal his continued existence rather than continuing his attempts to to attack from under his invisibility cloak.

Sometime after the [[Second Wizarding War]], Harry married Ginny, becoming Molly's son-in-law and officially joining the [[Weasley family]]. He was also the father of three of Molly's grandchildren: [[James Potter II|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]].

====Hermione Granger====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Mrs Weasley, you didn’t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in [[Witch Weekly]], did you? Because Hermione’s not my girlfriend.|Molly Weasley|Oh! No — of course I didn’t!|Harry Potter dispelling Molly's falsely influenced views about Hermione|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[File:Hermione Granger.jpg|233x233px|thumb|[[Hermione Granger]], her future daughter-in-law|alt=]]

Because of her friendships with Ron and Ginny, Hermione became friendly with the entire Weasley family. She spent portions of many of her summer holidays at [[the Burrow]] and attended some family outings with them, such as shopping for school supplies in [[Diagon Alley]] and the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]]. Molly was generally fond of Hermione, though she treated her coldly for a brief time after [[Rita Skeeter]] printed lies about Hermione toying with the hearts of [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Viktor Krum]], much to Hermione's bewilderment and dejection. After Harry explained that the stories were false, she once again warmed up to Hermione.

Hermione became one of Molly's four daughters-in-law when she married Ron sometime after the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Hermione is the mother of two of Molly's grandchildren: [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley]].

====Fleur Delacour====
{{Dialogue a-b|Molly|Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting? Whereas Bill and Fleur... well... what have they really got in common? He's a hard-working down-to-earth sort of person, whereas she's —|Ginny Weasley|A cow. But Bill's not that down-to-earth... he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour... I expect that's why he's gone for Phlegm.|Discussion of Bill's and Fleur's relationship|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Fleur Delacour.jpg|233x233px|thumb|[[Fleur Delacour]], her daughter-in-law|alt=|left]]

The [[Weasley family|Weasleys]]' reaction to Fleur (with the exceptions of Ron and Arthur) was initially lukewarm. They became more annoyed with Fleur when she and Bill became engaged, but tolerated her presence for his sake. In particular, Molly didn't like Fleur and was irked by the latter's criticism of her household or even her favourite singer [[Celestina Warbeck]]. 

When Fleur indignantly denied that [[William Weasley|Bill]]'s disfigurement at the hands of [[Fenrir Greyback]] would affect their marital plans in any way, the Weasleys saw how deeply Fleur loved Bill and finally became more accepting of her. Molly convinced her aunt Muriel to lend her future daughter-in-law a tiara for the wedding. Fleur was noted as fussing over and being protective of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in a motherly fashion, similar to Molly.

After the Second Wizarding War, Molly had three grandchildren through Fleur.
===Nymphadora Tonks===
{{Quote|Thanks for the tea and sympathy, Molly.|Tonks after confiding in Molly|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Nymphadora Tonks DH promo headshot .jpg|233x233px|thumb|[[Nymphadora Tonks]], her friend|alt=]]

Molly had a rather close relationship with [[Auror]] and fellow [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]] member, Nymphadora Tonks. Molly often invited Tonks to dine with the [[Weasley family]] and the young witch was always a welcome guest at the events held by the Weasley matriarch. Molly would at times get annoyed at Tonks due to her clumsiness, but never out of dislike for her. Rather it was mostly due to the fact that Tonks' attempts at helping resulting in her causing minor annoyances, such as setting off the [[Walburga Black's portrait|Portrait of Walburga Black at 12 Grimmauld Place]]. During these times, Molly would attempt to dissuade Tonks from helping, so as to avoid such accidents.

Though there was a significant difference in age between the two, Molly appeared to be Tonks's closest adult friend: She appeared to be the only person in whom Tonks confided her love of [[Remus Lupin]]. Several people suspected that Molly hoped her son [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] would fall in love with Tonks, rather than marry [[Fleur Delacour]] and Harry Potter noted Molly was acting somewhat frosty toward Lupin during the [[1996]] Christmas holidays, though he misinterpreted the reason why. Molly reacted heatedly to disparaging remarks made by Fleur in regards to Tonks, which is indicative of the high opinion she held for the young Auror. At the conclusion of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], it was Molly who duelled and killed Tonks' murderer and aunt Bellatrix, therefore avenging Tonks' death.

===Order of the Phoenix members===
[[File:Order of the Phoenix.png|250x250px|thumb|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]], her allies|alt=|left]]

Molly considered [[Albus Dumbledore]] to be the greatest wizard of all time. During the [[Second Wizarding War]], she was technically the first new recruit of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation both founded and led by Dumbledore, having been asked to help battle against Voldemort almost immediately after his return was discovered. Along with most of the wizarding world, Molly was devastated by Dumbledore's death, and attended his funeral in [[1997]].

[[Remus Lupin]] was close with the Weasley family, joined the re-instated Order, and saw Molly on a fairly regular basis. Lupin helped Molly get rid of a boggart that took the form of her family and Harry Potter dead; confessing to him that she was afraid of what would happen to her children and husband. Lupin comforted her, saying that he and the other members of the Order would take care of her family. After Dumbledore's death, Molly expressed her opinion that Lupin and Tonks should be together, as they loved each other, despite Lupin's protests that he was too old, too poor, and too dangerous for Tonks. During the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], Lupin saved George's life from Death Eaters, for which Molly was incredibly grateful. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Lupin and Tonks were killed, showing Molly grieving near their bodies.

Molly initially believed [[Sirius Black]] (her "cousin by marriage", as his aunt Lucretia married her uncle Ignatius) was a murderer, who had betrayed the [[Potter family]] to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in [[1981]], and didn't learn of his innocence until [[1995]]. While both Sirius and Molly lived at [[12 Grimmauld Place]], they argued over the latter's tendency to be overprotective of Sirius's godson Harry: Sirius reminded her she wasn't Harry's mother, while Molly considered Sirius to be too reckless and reminded him that Harry wasn't his father James. Nonetheless, they got along well for the most part, as Sirius was thrilled at having the Weasley family and Harry Potter stay at Grimmauld place over the 1995 winter holidays. Molly was greatly saddened by Sirius's death in [[1996]] and was ultimately the one to kill Bellatrix, Sirius's cousin and murderer.

Molly worked fairly closely with the late [[Alastor Moody]] and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], being on good terms with both of them. She was shocked by Moody's death in 1997. Kingsley was responsible for saving countless lives when he sent his [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] to warn the attendees of Bill and Fleur's [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] that the Ministry had fallen in [[1997]] and later became [[Minister for Magic]], employing a number of the members of Molly's family.

Molly was friendly with [[Minerva McGonagall]], the former [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] professor and [[Head of Gryffindor House]], the house into which all the members of the [[Weasley family]] had been sorted. The two discussed Dumbledore's death in 1997. McGonagall would have been Headmistress while several of Molly's grandchildren attended the school.

The Weasley family were all fond of [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the gamekeeper and later [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He fought alongside Molly at the Battle of Hogwarts and they both survived the war. He appeared to be friendly with Molly's grandchildren, as seen by his inviting Albus to his house for tea.

Molly seemed to be on good terms with [[Severus Snape]], despite the fact that he disliked her children. However, she and her family obviously turned against him when they learnt he killed Dumbledore, but it was most likely that this changed when she learned of Snape's true loyalties from Harry. In addition, Harry and Ginny would later name [[Albus Potter|one of Molly's grandsons]] after Snape.

==Etymology==
''Molly'' is a diminutive form of ''Mary'', the English form of the Hebrew name ''Miryam'', the meaning of which is unknown, though theories include "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", "wished for child", and "beloved". In the case of Molly Weasley, however, the name is most likely derived from the term "mollycoddle," meaning to "to pamper or overprotect."

The surname ''Prewett'' is Welsh in origin. It is derived from the Middle English word ''prou'', meaning "brave" or "valiant", and the suffix "-et", which implies smallness. Thus, it is believed to be derived from a nickname for someone small, but brave.

''Weasley'' is derived from the weasel, an animal [[J. K. Rowling]] is fond of. The term is especially appropriate for Molly, as a mother weasel is particularly protective of her young to the point that she will willingly take on animals several times bigger than her in defence of her offspring.

*Her husband's pet name for her, "Mollywobbles", may be a pun on "the collywobbles", British slang for a queasy stomach, especially when caused by anxiety. Possibly in reference to her constant fretting over the welfare of her loved ones.
*Contrary to rumours among fans that [[Neville Longbottom]] would be the one to kill [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[J. K. Rowling]] stated she had always intended for Molly to be the one to do it, for two main reasons: firstly, so that Molly could "have her moment" and show that simply because she had dedicated herself to her family did not mean that she was not a powerful witch, and secondly, to show the clash of Molly's "maternal love" against Bellatrix's "obsessive love".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more J.
