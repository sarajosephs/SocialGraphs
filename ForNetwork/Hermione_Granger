{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|But why's she got to go to the library?|Ronald Weasley|Because that's what Hermione does. When in doubt, go to the library.|Hermione's dependency on books|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
'''Minister Hermione Jean'''&lt;ref name="DH7"&gt;{{DH|B|7}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' Granger'''&lt;!-- Please do not change this. It is confirmed by Pottermore - the 2014 Quidditch Finale - that Hermione's surname is, as of 2014, still Granger - confirmed also in Cursed Child --&gt; (b. [[19 September]] [[1979]])&lt;ref name="birthday" /&gt; was an [[England|English]] [[Muggle-born]]&lt;ref name="PS"/&gt; [[Wizardkind|witch]] born to [[Hermione Granger's father|Mr]] and [[Hermione Granger's mother|Mrs Granger]]. At the age of eleven, she learned about her [[magic]]al nature and was accepted into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Hermione began attending Hogwarts in [[1991]] and was Sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. She possessed a brilliant academic mind and proved to be a gifted student in almost every subject that she studied, to the point where she was nearly made a [[Ravenclaw]] by the [[Sorting Hat]]. 

Hermione first met her future best friends [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] aboard the [[Hogwarts Express]], and initially they found her unfriendly and somewhat of an "insufferable know-it-all",  an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the [[professor]]s. However, she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they had saved her from a [[troll]] on [[Hallowe'en]] in [[1991]], surprising them in a grateful way, which led to them quickly becoming friends. She later played a crucial role in protecting the [[Philosopher's Stone]] from [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]].   

In her second year, Hermione had a key role in the discovery of the [[Chamber of Secrets]], before falling victim to the [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]] unleashed upon Hogwarts following the opening of the Chamber. However, she recovered from the [[petrification]] under the care of [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] with [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]]'s [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]]. The next year, Hermione was granted permission to use a [[Time-Turner]] from the [[Ministry of Magic]] to facilitate her volition to study far more subjects than were possible without time travel, though she and Harry later used it to rescue [[Sirius Black]] from the [[Dementor's Kiss]] and [[Buckbeak]] the [[hippogriff]] from execution.     

During her fourth year, Hermione became an advocate for the better treatment of [[House-elf|house-elves]], forming the association [[Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare|S.P.E.W.]], and helped in Harry's preparation for the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. In her fifth year, Hermione was the driving force behind the creation of [[Dumbledore's Army]] and fought alongside fellow D.A. members in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. In her sixth year, Hermione continued her role as [[Prefect]] and fought in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]].    

Hermione played a significant role in many other battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]], as well. In [[1997]], she fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], alongside the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Hermione and Ron decided not to return to Hogwarts for their final year of studies, instead choosing to accompany Harry on his quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's [[Horcrux-making spell|Horcruxes]], a quest in which several of her actions were essential. She destroyed [[Hufflepuff's Cup]], a Horcrux, with Ron using a Basilisk fang found in the Chamber of Secrets. Hermione then fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], helping in the defeat of the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who tortured her: [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].  

Following the Second Wizarding War, Hermione went back to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to complete her education. She later found employment with the Ministry of Magic, furthering the cause for the better treatment of house-elves. Afterward, she was promoted to the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], where she dedicated herself to eradicating old laws that were biased in favour of [[pure-blood]]s. Hermione eventually married Ron Weasley and together they had two children, [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]]. She became the godmother of Harry and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] Potter's eldest son [[James Potter II|James]]. By the year [[2019]], Hermione had become the [[Minister for Magic]].

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1979–1991}}===
{{Quote|Nobody in my familys magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard — I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough —|Hermione describing her Muggle heritage|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Granger family DH.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A young Hermione with her parents]]
Hermione was born to [[Hermione Granger's father|Mr]] and [[Hermione Granger's mother|Mrs Granger]] on [[19 September]] [[1979]]. She was their only child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm 4 March 2004 World Book Day Chat]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple choose "''a nice, unusual''" first name for her because they wanted to establish how educated and intelligent they were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-pressclubtransc.htm J. K. Rowling 1999 National Press Club luncheon Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt; Mr and Mrs Granger were "''a bit bemused''" by the oddities displayed by their daughter, but they were proud and accepting of her nonetheless. The couple gave Hermione a [[Hermione Granger's bedroom|bedroom]] on the first-floor of their house,&lt;ref name="DHPO"&gt;{{DH|F1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they lived happily for many years.

[[File:Young Hermione.png|250px|thumb|A young Hermione before starting Hogwarts]]
Upon turning eleven, Hermione was happily surprised to learn that she was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and was therefore invited to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She eagerly accepted and took to studying magic even before she began her first year at Hogwarts in the [[September]] of 1991, learning all the set spell books by heart and even managing to [[underage magic|perform]] "''a few spells''" at home successfully. In addition to the texts set by the school, Hermione brought with her several other books for reference and to further her understanding of the [[wizarding world]],&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;{{PS}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point that she had looked at books and had more knowledge of the wizarding world than some of her [[pure-blood]]/[[half-blood]] classmates.

===Hogwarts years {{C|1991–1997}}===
{{Dialogue a-b|Terry Boot|How come you're not in Ravenclaw? With brains like yours?|Hermione|Well, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting, but it decided on Gryffindor in the end.|Hermione's use of the advanced [[Protean Charm]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:WB HP F4 Goblet of Fire Hermione with a book.png|left|thumb|250x250px|Hermione and her fondness for textbooks]]
Hermione enjoyed her years as a pupil at Hogwarts and took assignments, classes, and school rules very seriously. She was often described as brilliant, to the point of being said to be "''the brightest witch of her age''". Her favourite subject was initially [[Charms (class)|Charms]], and later [[Arithmancy]]. Given her keen mind, some students — such as [[Terry Boot]] — wondered why Hermione was Sorted into [[Gryffindor]] rather than [[Ravenclaw]], and she admitted that the [[Sorting Hat]] did consider putting her in Ravenclaw. It is likely that the Sorting Hat ultimately put her in Gryffindor after stalling for about 4 minutes because Hermione chose to be in it, just like Harry chose to not be in Slytherin; this is reinforced by how on the train earlier she stated that "''Gryffindor... sounds by far the best.''"

She later proved her rightful place in Gryffindor with her steadfast bravery and loyalty to her friends, [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and [[Dumbledore's Army]]. After being Sorted into Gryffindor, Hermione shared a dormitory with [[Lavender Brown]], [[Parvati Patil]], [[Fay Dunbar]] and an unnamed ginger-haired girl.&lt;ref name="OOTP"&gt;{{OOTP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of always wanting to follow the school rules, after Hermione became friends with Harry and Ron, she would disobey the rules along with them in order to successfully complete their group affairs. For example, she went with Ron and Harry into the third-floor corridor in their first year, which students were temporarily forbidden from entering, in order to save the Philosopher's Stone; she assisted in creating the Polyjuice Potion in their second year; and although Harry was the one who taught Dumbledore's Army in their fifth year, she was the one who came up with the idea.

====First year====
=====Meeting Harry and Ron=====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione Granger|Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one.|Ron Weasley|We've already told him we haven't seen it.|Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.|Hermione's first interaction with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Trio meet.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The trio meeting for the first time aboard the [[Hogwarts Express]]]]
Hermione was a couple of weeks away from turning twelve when she boarded the Hogwarts Express in [[1991]], where she met Harry Potter and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] while helping [[Neville Longbottom]] find his pet [[toad]], [[Trevor]]. Hermione demonstrated knowledge and talent with [[magic]] beyond most of those her age, despite having only recently discovered that she was a [[Wizardkind|witch]]. She wished to be a [[Gryffindor]] or a [[Ravenclaw]], and her wish was granted considering she did get sorted into Gryffindor.

[[File:Harry-potter1-sorting1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione being [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] by the [[Sorting Hat]]]]
Hermione soon proved to be the best in all her classes, eager to please the professors and to help others learn, albeit in a bossy way that made it difficult for her to make friends. Although she was a know-it-all, Hermione did often help Neville Longbottom, who struggled in most classes other than [[Herbology]].&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; 

Hermione strictly followed all school rules and tried to prevent other students from breaking rules and getting into trouble. On one night, she followed Harry and Ron as they were leaving Gryffindor Tower to [[Duelling|duel]] [[Draco Malfoy]]. They were chased by [[Argus Filch]], acting on a tipoff by Malfoy, into the third-floor corridor — forbidden to students — where they came face-to-face with [[Fluffy]], a three-headed dog belonging to [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. Later on, she argued that her spying was to their benefit when she pointed out the dog had been standing on a trapdoor, which neither Harry nor Ron had noticed.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt;

=====[[Hallowe'en]]=====
{{Quote|There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.|The creation of the trio's special friendship|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:First floor girls bathroom.png|250px|thumb|The mountain troll entering the bathroom that Hermione's in during the Hallowe'en feast]]
The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was solidified when, on [[31 October|Hallowe'en]] in [[1991]], the three were forced to confront [[Troll in the Bathroom|a mountain troll]], which had been secretly let into the school by Professor [[Quirinus Quirrell]]. Unaware that a troll was on the loose in the school, Hermione had spent that day crying in the girls' bathroom after overhearing Ron making unkind comments about her. 

The troll made its way into the bathroom she was in, and Harry and Ron came to her rescue, saving her. When Professors [[Minerva McGonagall]], [[Severus Snape]] and [[Quirinus Quirrell]] arrived at the scene, Hermione covered for the boys, claiming she was fighting the troll because she had thought that she could manage, having read a great deal about them and that Ron and Harry had merely come to help her escape. From then on, the three students were best friends and spent large amounts of time together.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt;

=====Hagrid's dragon=====
{{Quote|They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.|Harry and Hermione prepare to drop Norbert off with Charlie's freinds|Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone}}
[[File:Hermione sets fire to cloak.gif|250px|thumb|left|Hermione setting [[Severus Snape|Snape's]] robes on fire during a [[Quidditch]] match]]
The incident with the troll was by no means her only adventure in that first year. During the first [[Quidditch]] match, Hermione set [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s robes on [[Bluebell Flames|fire]] when she thought he was [[jinx]]ing Harry's broom. In the spring of [[1992]], [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], now a friend of Hermione's through Harry, managed to procure a [[Dragon egg]], the unlicensed possession of which was illegal. The three children secretly helped [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] care for the beast, which he'd named [[Norberta|Norbert]]. When the dragon was discovered, she and Harry smuggled it out of the school to some friends of Ron's elder brother, [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]], who worked as a dragon-tamer. 

On their way back to the dormitories they were caught by [[Argus Filch]], who escorted them to [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor Minerva McGonagall]]. Along with [[Neville Longbottom]] and [[Draco Malfoy]], they received detention and had fifty points deducted each from their respective houses.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt;

[[File:Fluffy1.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry, Ron, and Hermione running into Fluffy in the third-floor corridor]]
After their run-in with [[Fluffy]], Harry deduced that whatever Hagrid had retrieved from [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] was beneath the trapdoor. Hagrid let it slip that "''... What's under that trapdoor is strictly between [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and [[Nicolas Flamel|Nicholas Flamel]]''". After much research turned up nothing, Harry was given a Dumbledore [[Chocolate Frog Card]] by Neville, which mentions Dumbledore's work in [[Alchemy]] with Flamel. This led Hermione to look at a large book on Alchemy which she had borrowed from the [[Hogwarts Library|library]] for "''a bit of light reading''". After consulting the book, she realised that Fluffy was guarding the [[Philosopher's Stone]].&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt;

=====The Underground Chambers=====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione Granger|Brilliant. This isn't magic — it's logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.|Harry Potter|But so will we, won't we?|Of course not. Everything we need is here on this paper.|Hermione cleverly working out how to solve the potion riddle in the Underground Chambers|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Harry-potter1-trio chess.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The trio standing as a unified front during the human chess match]]
Fearing that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] would return if he stole the stone, and believing that Snape was acting as a double agent and attempting to steal it, Harry decided to steal it first. When he told Hermione that he could go on alone, she rebuffed him. After the trio passed Fluffy, it was Hermione who freed Ron from a patch of [[Devil's Snare]] he had dropped into by conjuring [[Bluebell Flames]]. She later got herself and Harry through a challenge involving a [[potion riddle]] in order to obtain the right potion between many of them. Hermione used her logic to figure out the riddle and let Harry go forward without her, as there was only enough potion for one person.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt;

Later, at the Farewell Feast in the [[Great Hall]], Hermione, Harry, Ron, and Neville were all awarded extra [[House points]] for bravery and heroism, allowing [[Gryffindor]] to win the [[House Cup]]. Hermione earned fifty points for Gryffindor by correctly solving Professor Snape's potion riddle.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt;

====Second year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione|Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine. I don't want to break rules, you know. I think threatening [[Muggle-born]]s is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don't want to find out....|Ron Weasley|I never thought I'd see the day when you'd be persuading us to break rules.|Hermione breaking school rules in an attempt to catch the Heir of Slytherin|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
Before she started her second year, Hermione wrote several letters to Harry at [[Privet Drive]], all of which were intercepted by [[Dobby]], as the [[house-elf]] wanted Harry to believe that his friends had forgotten him in order to prevent his return to Hogwarts. She and [[Granger family|her parents]] also accompanied Harry and the [[Weasley family]] to [[Diagon Alley]] to shop for school supplies.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

[[File:Harry-potter2 draco hermione.jpg|250px|thumb|Draco Malfoy calling Hermione the derogatory slur "[[Mudblood]]"]]
It was during her second school year that Hermione first encountered the prejudice and hatred surrounding her [[blood status]], when [[Draco Malfoy]] called her a "''filthy little Mudblood''" after she told him off for insulting the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. Hermione had never heard the highly offensive term but looking around at everyone around her, it was an obvious fact. [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] lunged at him, and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] even tried to hex him, but it backfired, as his wand had been damaged. To help Hermione feel better about the incident, Hagrid urged her not to think about it, pointing out that she was a talented witch, regardless of what bigoted people said about her [[Muggle-born]] status.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

Harry and Ron were surprised, and Ron annoyed, by Hermione's obvious crush on [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], who became that year's [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor. She scored full marks on the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts Second Year Essential Knowledge Test|first quiz in his class]], which consisted entirely of questions pertaining to Lockhart's books, including a question regarding his favourite colour (lilac) that most of the class had answered incorrectly. In fact, she went as far as to doodle hearts on her DADA assignments, not knowing until later that he was, in reality, a self-obsessed fraud.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

[[File:Trio writing on wall.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The writing on the wall and the Petrified form of [[Mrs Norris]]]]
On [[Hallowe'en]] [[1992]] Hermione attended [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party]] with Harry and Ron. Whilst heading back upstairs, she followed Harry in a detour, after he claimed to be hearing voices. They discovered the [[Hogwarts Caretaker|caretaker]]'s cat, [[Mrs Norris]], petrified and the walls vandalised. Hermione began spending all her free time in the Hogwarts Library after she saw the writing on the corridor walls, which had said that the [[Chamber of Secrets]] had been re-opened. Despite hoping to read about the legend, she could not, as all the books had been previously checked out.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

[[File:B2C9M1 Cuthbert Binns on the Chamber of Secrets.png|250px|thumb|Hermione asking Professor Binns about the [[Chamber of Secrets]]]]
Hermione shocked everyone when she actually interrupted [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]] during a [[History of Magic]] class, asking about the Chamber of Secrets. This was the only known time when a student had asked the boring professor a question, and the class was interested in what he had to say. Professor Binns had stated that [[Salazar Slytherin]] had hidden a chamber which consisted of a horrible monster. It had been unleashed before once by an "[[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]]", petrifying many Muggle-born and had also killed a [[Ravenclaw]] girl, named [[Myrtle Warren]], who began haunting the girls' lavatory and became known as Moaning Myrtle. Slytherin, a pure-blood loyalist, was against Muggle-born children being allowed to attend Hogwarts, but he was outnumbered by the other founders and Muggle-borns like Hermione were permitted as students. Slytherin fled the school, but rumours spread that he had built a hidden chamber; it was said that the school had been searched many times, but no such chamber had been found.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

[[File:Brewing potions.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione brewing [[Polyjuice Potion]], used by the trio in an attempt to gain information from Draco Malfoy]]
When Harry proposed the theory that [[Draco Malfoy]] was the Heir of Slytherin, Hermione and Ron agreed. Hermione suggested that they brew [[Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice]] Potion, and temporarily transform themselves into Slytherin students in an attempt to find out the truth. She went even further by daring to check ''[[Moste Potente Potions]]'' out of the library using a note from Professor Lockhart — who had no idea what the book was — in the desire to research the potion. The book was in the [[Restricted Section]] and therefore unavailable to younger students without permission from a teacher. She hoped that they would be able to obtain a viable confession from Malfoy, if he was unaware he was being interrogated. She brewed the potion in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, as no one used it due to Myrtle herself being highly irritating. She also risked serious consequences when she stole potion ingredients from [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s [[Potions Storeroom|personal cupboards]] that were needed for the difficult potion, which took a month to brew.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

[[File:Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-2002-books-male-characters-29996396-500-375.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The trio discuss possible theories behind Tom Riddle's mysterious diary]]
Unfortunately, Hermione was unable to join Harry and Ron in the ruse with Polyjuice Potion because the hair she obtained from Slytherin [[Millicent Bulstrode]] during their scuffle in the [[Duelling Club]] was actually the hair of Bulstrode's cat. Hermione grew fur and a tail and remained in the [[Hospital Wing]] for weeks as she did not transform back when the normal duration of effectiveness — one hour — was up. Harry and Ron, however, were able to use the potion she brewed to transform into [[Gregory Goyle]] and [[Vincent Crabbe]], respectively. They entered the [[Slytherin]] [[Slytherin Dungeon|common room]], and through conversation with [[Draco Malfoy]], realised that he was not the Heir of Slytherin, and was not involved in the opening of the Chamber after all.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

=====Petrification=====
{{Quote|Colin saw it through his camera. The Basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin... Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn't die again... and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just realised the monster was a Basilisk.|Hermione was a victim of Petrification|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Petrified Hermione.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A Petrified Hermione in the [[Hospital Wing]]]]
Months after her recovery from the Polyjuice complication, Hermione suffered another accident. Drawing the connection between Harry hearing voices in the walls and him being a Parselmouth, she came to the conclusion that the creature attacking students must be a [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]], and rushed to the library to conduct further research. On her way back from the library, she warned the first person she saw, [[Penelope Clearwater]], and advised her to look around corners with a mirror before going anywhere. It saved both their lives, because they were both [[Petrification|petrified]] when they spotted the Basilisk's eyes through the mirror instead of dying immediately as they would have done if they'd looked straight into its eyes.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

Though she was petrified for the rest of the school year, Hermione was still able to assist Harry and Ron, for she had torn out the page on Basilisks and scribbled on it "'''''pipes'''''", referencing the manner in which the creature had moved around the school undetected. Harry and Ron found it clenched in her hand when they were finally allowed to visit her in the Hospital Wing. Using this note and other information they had gathered, Harry and Ron were able to successfully put an end to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s plans to resurrect his body through his memory stored in [[T. M. Riddle's Diary|an old school diary]].&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

[[File:Hermione unpetrified.jpg|250px|thumb|A fully recovered Hermione]]
Hermione was later cured with a [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]] created by [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]]. Upon arriving at the Great Hall, she was immediately greeted by Nearly Headless Nick. After hugging Harry she exchanged an awkward greeting with Ron. Hermione was disappointed to learn that, as a special treat for the school, Professor Dumbledore cancelled the students' end of year exams, but she was intensely proud that her friends had solved the mystery.&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;{{COS}}&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, Hermione went on holiday to [[France]] with her [[Granger family|parents]].&lt;ref name="POA"&gt;{{POA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Where did you get that hourglass thing?|Hermione Granger|It's called a Time-Turner, and I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day back. I've been using it all year to get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn't tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one. She had to tell them that I was a model student, and that I'd never, ever use it for anything except my studies.... I've been turning it back so I could do hours over again, that's how I've been doing several lessons at once, see?|Hermione explaning to Harry her use of a [[Time-Turner]] during her third year|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Magical Menagerie.png|250px|thumb|left|Hermione adopting Crookshanks from the [[Diagon Alley|Magical Menagerie]]]]
Just before she began the 1993-1994 school year, while visiting [[Diagon Alley]] with Harry and the [[Weasley family]], Hermione met and adopted a ginger part-[[Kneazle]] cat named [[Crookshanks]] from the [[Diagon Alley|Magical Menagerie]]. However, her new bond with her cat caused friction with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and his pet rat [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]], as Crookshanks was always trying to catch the rat. Also at the beginning of this school year, Hermione obtained a [[Time-Turner]] from Professor McGonagall so she could double up on classes, though this was kept secret from everyone, even Harry and Ron.

When Harry received a [[Harry Potter's Firebolt|Firebolt]] for Christmas with no note, Hermione reported it to Professor McGonagall, thinking it was sent by [[Sirius Black]], whom everyone believed to be a dangerous murderer who was after Harry. His broom was taken away to be inspected, which caused a temporary rift between the two friends. There was a further social strain for Hermione when Ron accused Crookshanks of eating Scabbers, who had disappeared.

[[File:Hermione punching Draco GIF.gif|250px|thumb|Hermione hitting Draco Malfoy for cruelly mocking [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]]]
Hermione poured herself into defending [[Buckbeak]], the [[hippogriff]] on trial before the [[Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures]] for attacking [[Draco Malfoy]] during a [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class. Once the trio reconciled, after Hagrid told Harry and Ron how disappointed he was when they selfishly put the Firebolt and Scabbers over their friendship with Hermione, they apologised. Their attempt to save Buckbeak failed, as [[Lucius Malfoy]] frightened the Committee into deciding that the creature would be executed. Hermione was extremely upset by this news and grew furious to the point of slapping Draco Malfoy when he dared to mock Hagrid for his tears and being upset over Buckbeak's fate.

That year, Hermione was among the students who found [[Remus Lupin]] to be the best [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher they have ever had. She cleverly deduced that Professor Lupin was a [[werewolf]], based on his Boggart taking the form of a full moon, the timing of his unexplained absences from class, and [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] changing a lesson he took over to the subject of werewolves even though it wasn't due on the syllabus for weeks. However, she didn't expose Lupin, presumably because she believed he was a good teacher and didn't agree with the prejudice many hold against werewolves. 

[[Divination]], on the other hand, turned out to be a subject Hermione had no respect for or interest in, and soon dropped the subject after Professor [[Sybill Trelawney]] told her that she did not posses the [[Inner Eye|Second Sight]] and because she believed that Divination was an imprecise branch of magic.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt;

=====Rescue of Sirius Black and Buckbeak=====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Hermione|Harry, I don't understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he tell us to go back three hours? How's that going to help Sirius?|Harry Potter|There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change. What happened?

We just heard ourselves leaving...|Dumbledore just said — just said we could save more than one innocent life... Hermione, we're going to save Buckbeak!|Harry and Hermione use a Time-Turner to save Sirius Black|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Encounter in the Shrieking Shack.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Professor Lupin and Sirius Black with the trio, before forcing [[Pettigrew family|Pettigrew]] into human form]]
On the day of Buckbeak's execution, the trio ventured down to console Hagrid. While in his cabin, Hermione discovered [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]], Ron's lost rat. Hagrid urged them to leave and they witnessed from a distance what they believed to be Buckbeak's execution. Before they could return to their dormitory, Scabbers bit Ron and fled. While chasing after the rat, they were attacked by a [[Sirius Black|black dog]], which pulled Ron by the leg into a tunnel beneath the [[Whomping Willow]], which then attacked them.

Afterward, Hermione and Harry hurried after them eventually arriving in the [[Shrieking Shack]], where Sirius Black, whose [[Animagus]] form was the black dog, confronted them. They were soon joined by Professor Lupin who was acting strangely, and Hermione told Harry and Ron of her belief that he was a werewolf, which he then confirmed. It was revealed that Sirius had been framed for the betrayal of [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]], and that the true traitor was Peter Pettigrew, who had been hiding from the world as Ron's pet rat. Hermione also cast ''[[Disarming Charm|Expelliarmus]]'' on Snape when he discovered them, knocking him out, at which she was horrified.

[[File:B3C20M2 Lake surrounded by Dementors.png|250px|thumb|Harry, Hermione, and Sirius being attacked by Dementors at the Black Lake]]
Once it had been decided that Pettigrew would be turned over to the authorities rather than murdered, the motley group left the Shrieking Shack. When the full moon appeared, chaos ensued as Lupin transformed into a werewolf as, due to the chaotic turn of events, he hadn't taken the [[Wolfsbane Potion|Wolfsbane]] potion that Professor Snape produced for him monthly in order for him to retain his humanity. In the chaos, Pettigrew attacked Ron and escaped, and Sirius had to transform into his dog form in order to protect Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the werewolf. After Lupin was eventually distracted by a howl from the [[Forbidden Forest]], Hermione and Harry rushed to Sirius' aid when they heard him moaning, but hundreds of [[Dementor]]s descended on them, come to recapture Sirius who quickly fainted, and Harry told Hermione to think of something happy and attempt to cast a [[Patronus Charm|patronus]] as he was trying to himself, but she was unable to cast one. 

As Harry conjured an incorporeal Patronus, Hermione passed out, leaving Harry to fight the Dementors alone. Harry held them off for a while but was eventually overwhelmed. The Dementors were about to perform the [[Dementor's Kiss|Kiss]] on Harry, Hermione, and Sirius when a mysterious figure in the distance cast a very powerful [[Patronus Charm]] to repel the Dementors. Unable to see properly in the resulting blinding light, Harry thought he glimpsed his father just before he, too, lost consciousness.

[[File:Turning time.gif|250px|thumb|left|Harry and Hermione using the Time-turner]]
Harry and Hermione awoke in the [[Hospital Wing]] after being rescued by [[Severus Snape]], who conjured stretchers for Hermione, Harry and Sirius. After realising that Sirius' soul was to be destroyed by the Dementor's Kiss and receiving vague, though instructive and useful, instructions from [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], Hermione used her [[Time-Turner]] to return herself and Harry to a time earlier in the evening. It was a very difficult task and Harry had to be constantly reminded by Hermione to stay concealed as being seen could cause irreparable damage to their timelines. Hermione agreed with Harry that it was difficult to watch their problems again, but she strictly said that they could do nothing about it, as bad things happened to wizards who tried to meddle with their past and future lives.

[[File:Rescue of Sirius and Buckbeak.png|250px|thumb|Harry and Hermione setting Sirius Black and [[Buckbeak]] free]]
The two did, however, successfully use the opportunity to [[Rescue of Sirius Black and Buckbeak|rescue]] Sirius and also Buckbeak, as it was hinted by Dumbledore that more than one innocent life could be spared that night.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; Whilst waiting, she discussed their saviour with Harry, and when Harry realised that it was not his father he saw but himself having travelled back in time, she claimed that none but a powerful wizard could have conjured a Patronus to drive away that many Dementors. As evidenced by her assertion that time-travelling was extremely dangerous, Hermione took great personal risk to save Sirius and Buckbeak. At the end of the year Hermione returned her Time-Turner, claiming it caused too much trouble and that she would drop a few subjects instead, which was a very big surprise to everyone.

====Fourth year====
{{Quote|You know, house-elves get a very raw deal! It's slavery, that's what it is! That [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Mr Crouch]] made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he's got her bewitched so she can't even run when they start trampling tents! Why doesn't anyone do something about it?|Hermione beginning her [[Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare|campaign]] for the better treatment of house-elves|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:The trio seeing the Dark Mark.png|250px|thumb|left|Ron, Harry, and Hermione after the riot of the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]]]
Before her fourth year at Hogwarts, Hermione spent much of the summer holidays at the [[the Burrow|Burrow]] with [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], sharing a room with [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]. With the other [[Weasley family|Weasleys]] (excluding Molly Weasley), they attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup in [[August]]. After the game, the communal campsite was set upon by [[Death Eaters]]. Hermione, Harry, and Ron fled into the woods and witnessed the casting of ''[[Morsmordre spell|Morsmordre]]''. Initially caught up in the chaos surrounding the effort to catch the caster, she took exception to the accusations levelled against Harry, and the many wizards' treatment of the house-elf [[Winky]] who had also been at the scene.

Once at Hogwarts, it was revealed to the students that former [[Auror]] [[Alastor Moody]] (who was, in fact, a polyjuiced [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]]) was to be the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor, Lupin having left at the end of the previous year due to Snape outing his werewolf status. Moody was a hands-on professor who believed in a practical approach when it came to defence. One of his earliest lessons was on the [[Unforgivable Curses]]. Hermione and her fellow classmates witnessed the curse's effects on a spider. 

=====Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare=====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Ron Weasley|Never heard of it.|Hermione|Well, of course you haven't. I've only just started it.|And how many members do you have?|Well, if you two join, three.|The beginning of S.P.E.W.|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:B4C14M2 Hedwig's Gryffindor Common Room delivery.png|250px|thumb|The first "meeting" of the [[Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare]]]]
Hermione began a crusade for the liberation of [[house-elf|house-elves]] by beginning the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, or what she and the group called S.P.E.W, (or, as [[Ronald Weasley]] called it, "spew") having been appalled by [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch]]'s abusive treatment of his house-elf [[Winky]]. This did not earn her any popularity, as most believed that house-elves enjoy their work; indeed, even the house-elves did not like her campaigning. 

Harry, Ron, and Neville only reluctantly joined S.P.E.W., mostly in order to prevent Hermione from nagging them about it. Hagrid as well as [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] refused to join on the grounds that it would upset the house-elves. Despite this, Fred did tell Hermione how to get into the Hogwarts kitchens. One morning she (along with Harry and Ron) visited the kitchens, where she spoke to [[Dobby]] and Winky. Dobby was pleased to see Harry and his friends and proceeded to tell them his struggles as a freed elf.

[[File:Dobby PM B4C21M2 DobbyAndWinkyOtherHouseElvesInHogwartsKitchen Moment.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The trio visiting the house-elves in the Hogwarts kitchen]]
While the trio were within the kitchen it was revealed that Winky was so saddened by the lose of her previous job that she had taken to drinking [[Butterbeer]], as a means to get drunk and numb her pain. Hermione considered Dobby to be a good example of a free elf and tried to comfort Winky about being sacked by Crouch. This did little good, however, as Winky soon became upset by Hermione's claims that house-elves deserved to have holidays and wages. Winky was not the only elf bothered by this, as the other elves stated that proper house-elves would never need such things and to want them is considered very shameful.

=====Viktor Krum=====
{{Quote|How did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?|Viktor invited Hermione to spend the summer with him|Harry Potter and the goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Harry &amp; Hermione talking.jpg|250px|thumb|Hermione believed Harry without question when he said he did not enter his name in the Triwizard Tournament]]
After the events surrounding Harry's name coming out of the [[Goblet of Fire]], Hermione was the only student who believed Harry's innocence. In fact, she "''accepted his story without question''". Even Ron was suspicious that Harry had cheated in order to gain more glory, creating a rift between the two for some time. Hermione helped Harry prepare for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament by helping him learn useful spells. Some of the spells were ''[[Stunning Spell|Stupefy]]'', ''[[Impediment Jinx|Impedimenta]]'', ''[[Summoning Charm|Accio]]'', the [[Shield Charm]], and the [[Four-Point Spell]]. She also tried to get Harry and Ron to talk to one another multiple times.

Hermione unknowingly attracted the interest of [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]] Triwizard Champion and Bulgarian International [[Seeker]], [[Viktor Krum]]. He was attracted to her due to her intelligence, unconventional beauty, and the manner in which she declined to hound him for autographs, unlike other girls. Krum began following Hermione to the library and other places around Hogwarts, including the library. This was something that Hermione found very irritating, as she couldn't work when surrounded by giggling girls, who had taken it upon themselves to follow Krum throughout the castle and the school grounds. Krum even bizarrely asked Harry if it was all right for him to pursue Hermione. He eventually asked her to attend the [[Yule Ball]] with him, and she accepted, not telling anyone but [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] that she was his date.

[[File:Yule ball7.gif|250px|thumb|left|Hermione dancing with her date, Viktor Krum at the Yule Ball]]
Thus, when the pair arrived, many were stunned and jealous. Hermione wore robes of a "''floaty, periwinkle-blue material''", and her hair in an "''elegant knot at the back of her head''".&lt;ref name="GOF"&gt;{{GOF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attention to her appearance was unusual, and she received many positive remarks on it. Even Draco Malfoy and [[Pansy Parkinson]] had nothing negative to say. Hermione commented that she had used [[Sleekeazy's Hair Potion]], but that it was too much work to use it every day. 

Upon seeing Hermione with Krum, Ron was overcome with jealousy. Hermione had hoped for Ron to ask her, but his invitation was insensitive and at the last minute due to him not being able to find anyone else. The two rowed about it in the common room after the ball, in which she revealed that he should have asked her properly and not "''as a last resort''", but Ron misunderstood the point. After that, the two were seemingly more polite to each other, although more distant for a time and Ron continued to show dislike and distrust towards Krum.

=====Imprisoned by sea creatures=====
{{Quote|Ron was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur Delacour's sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep.

[[File:HP-GOF-second task.gif|250px|thumb|Hermione inside the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]] during the second task]]
Hermione was chosen as a "''kidnap victim''" for Krum during the Tournament's second task, something that she subsequently endured teasing over. She was taken to the bottom of the Black Lake to await rescue from Krum, who donned a half-shark [[Transfiguration]]. While in the Black Lake Harry was conflicted and wanted to retrive her as much as he wanted to retrieve Ron. He stated that "''she was his friend too''". Krum managed to rescue her and carried her to the surface, where he revealed to her later that he "''never felt this way about any other girl''" and asked her to visit him in [[Bulgaria]] over the summer.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; 

Krum was jealous of Hermione's relationship with Harry Potter, thinking that there may have been something romantic between them that went beyond just plain friendship. The jealousy was founded based on the lies in the ''[[Daily Prophet]] and ''Harry was quick to inform Krum of these lies.

=====Rita Skeeter=====
{{Quote|No, you see... Rita Skeeter — is an unregistered Animagus. She can turn — into a beetle.|Hermione Granger exposing Rita's abilities as an Animagus|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:B4C28M1 Hermione opening hate mails.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione receiving hate mail from the readers of ''[[Witch Weekly]]'' in response to Skeeter's article]]
[[Rita Skeeter]], a journalist for the ''Daily Prophet'' and unregistered [[Animagus]], was hiding in beetle form in Hermione's hair during her conversation with Viktor. Hermione had previously reprimanded Skeeter for printing horrible lies about Harry and [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. This angered the journalist, who wrote a scathing article on "''the devious Miss Granger''", claiming that she was toying with both Harry and Krum's affections and that she had developed a taste for famous wizards.  

Skeeter even went so far to claim that Hermione was possibly brewing [[Love Potion|love potions]]. In the words of Ron, Skeeter was making Hermione out to be a "''Scarlet Woman''", a phrase which made Hermione laugh. She called Hermione "''plain''" in the article, in spite of previously reporting Hermione as Harry's "''stunningly pretty... girlfriend''" by likely twisting and sensationalising the words of [[Colin Creevey]] and thus using this as the basis for the article. 

Although Hermione found the lies ridiculous, some people believed them and started sending Hermione hate mail, including one filled with [[Bubotuber Pus]], and even [[Molly Weasley]] treated her coldly until Harry corrected her. Hermione vowed to get revenge on Skeeter for her libel, and wondered how she was getting her information, as several things Skeeter knew had only been discussed in private conversations. This led her to come to the realisation that Skeeter was an illegal unregistered [[Animagus]], who took the form of a beetle to secretly witness confidential exchanges.

=====Return of Lord Voldemort=====
{{Quote|Oh, Rita hasn't written anything at all since the third task. As a matter of fact. Rita Skeeter isn't going to be writing anything at all for a while. Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her.|Hermione discovered that Rita Skeeter was an unregistered Animagus|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:B4C36M1 Snape Dark Mark reveal.png|250px|thumb|Hermione was present when the Minister for Magic visited Harry in the hospital wing]]
The students were shocked when Harry returned at the end of the third and final task with Cedric Diggory's dead body. Hermione was relieved to see Harry when he was brought to the infirmary by Professor Dumbledore. She was upset with [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]] when he refused to believe Harry and Dumbledore about the truth of Voldemort's return. During her time with Harry in the Hospital Wing, she noticed Skeeter on a windowsill, attempting to eavesdrop, and captured her in the process. Hermione did not go against Harry's story when she finally heard it, sticking by her best friend.

On the ride home on the [[Hogwarts Express]], Hermione happily revealed to Harry and Ron that she uncovered Skeeter's status as an unregistered Animagus and had trapped her in a jar. She as an unregistered beetle Animagus that used her tiny size to come onto school grounds and listen to private conversations. She was not allowed onto school grounds and Hermione caught her on a windowsill in the hospital wing. Hermione also noticed the markings around Rita's antennae were exactly like the foul glasses she wore. She kept Skeeter from writing for a year by threatening to expose her to the authorities. 

She single-handed drove Skeeter into poverty, gaining revenge for the pain caused to Harry and her other friends. However, with the [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the murder of [[Cedric Diggory]] at the end of the school year,&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; there were much more serious challenges ahead for Hermione and her friends.

====Fifth year====
{{Dialogue|Harry Potter|Been having a nice little chat with [[Lavender Brown|her]] about whether or not I'm a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?|Hermione|No, I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down Ron and my throats, Harry, because if you haven't noticed, we're on your side.|An argument over people's differing opinions on Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:B5C6M1 Doxycide Grimmauld Place.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione with others in 12 Grimmauld Place preparing to clean]]
Following the death of [[Cedric Diggory]], the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] refused to accept Harry and [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s claims that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned, and the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' labelled them either liars or nutters. However, Hermione and Ron believed Harry and defended him against the criticism of doubtful classmates. Though occasionally Harry vented his frustration at them, the two stuck by him. The trio also wanted to become members of the reconvened [[Order of the Phoenix]] but were not allowed to because they were under-age. Hermione helped exterminate [[12 Grimmauld Place]], which served as headquarters for the Order, and was immensely relieved when Harry was acquitted of the charge of having used underage magic in the presence of a muggle, after him and [[Dudley Dursley]] were attacked by a Dementor in [[Little Whinging]].

Before returning to Hogwarts, she and Ron learned that they had been appointed prefects for [[Gryffindor]] house, to the secret consternation of Harry, who couldn't believe Ron had been chosen over him. She took her position very seriously. Once the school year began, Hermione resumed some of her activism on behalf of house-elves, though she was not as intense about [[Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare|S.P.E.W.]] as she had been the previous year. 

[[File:Fifth year Hogwarts carriage.jpg|250px|thumb|The trio and Neville meet Luna Lovegood for the first time]]
She learned how to knit socks and hats for the house-elves and hid them in Gryffindor Tower, disguising them with crumpled rubbish in an attempt to trick the house-elves into accidentally freeing themselves. The elves found this attempt insulting, and they stopped cleaning the Tower at all. [[Dobby]] was the only one who enjoyed the gifts, took everything Hermione had made, and cleaned the Tower by himself, a fact which Hermione didn't know. 

Hermione was challenged in more ways than one that year when she met [[Luna Lovegood]], whose belief in many things without logical grounds baffled Hermione. However, the two became friends after accepting one another's differences.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;

=====Dumbledore's Army=====
{{Quote|Harry, don't you see? This... this is exactly why we need you... We need to know what it's really like... facing him... facing V-Voldemort. Well... think about it. Please?|Hermione persuading Harry Potter to teach practical defence|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Dumbledore's Army learning Expelliarmus.gif|250px|thumb|left|Hermione practising with Dumbledore's Army in the Room of Requirement]]
Meanwhile, it was not long before Hermione realised that the Ministry of Magic had decided to interfere at Hogwarts. [[Dolores Umbridge]], a cruel, falsely sweet Ministry employee with a personality like "''poisoned honey''", was appointed as the new professor of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] and Hermione, like Harry and Ron, disliked Umbridge for many reasons, one of which being that she refused to teach students practical defence, focusing only on theory, despite their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|OWLs]] being later that year. 

With this being the case, Hermione decided that Hogwarts needed a competent teacher and, together with Harry and Ron, founded [[Dumbledore's Army]], a secret organisation in which students would gather after classes and be taught practical defensive spells. She suggested that Harry be the teacher; though he originally thought the idea ridiculous, he consented to teach the class. The name was suggested by Ginny, who recalled the conversation they'd had about Fudge's greatest fear being that Dumbledore would form an army of students if the Ministry did not intervene at Hogwarts.

[[File:Hermione's Patronus.gif|250px|thumb|Hermione conjuring her [[otter]] [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]]]
One of the many advanced spells Hermione learned was the [[Patronus Charm]]; hers took the corporeal form of an [[otter]].&lt;ref name="OOTP27" /&gt; Hermione became one of the few people brave enough to call [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] by his actual name. However, Hermione made the mistake of arranging the first meeting to take place in the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], as opposed to the Three Broomsticks, which Sirius, appearing in the Gryffindor Common Room fire, said would have made it a lot harder for anyone to overhear. [[Willy Widdershins]], who was in the Hog's Head, went to Umbridge, who instituted [[Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four]] to forbid any type of students groups from being formed under her watchful eye.

=====Christmas on the Closed Ward=====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|What are you doing here? I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad?|Hermione|Well, to tell the truth, skiing's not really my thing. So, I've come here for Christmas.|Hermione stays at [[Grimmauld Place]] during Charistmas|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:StMungos PM B5C23M1 ChristmasAtStMungos Moment.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The trio and Ginny in St Mungo's after visiting Arthur Weasley]]
Halfway through the year at Hogwarts, Harry had a vision of Voldemort's snake, [[Nagini]], biting Mr Weasley during his task for the Order of the Phoenix. Mr Weasley was carried into [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's Hospital]], where Mrs Weasley screamed at him for trying to stitch his wound instead of healing it with magic. 

Hermione was one of the few who visited him and stayed at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place for a couple of weeks until Mr Weasley was nursed back to health. Hermione had managed to convince her parents by telling them that skiing wasn't ''really'' her thing and that people who were serious about their exams stayed at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and studied.

=====Impressive spell work=====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Terry Boot|You can do a [[Protean Charm]]?|Hermione|Yes.|But that's... that's N.E.W.T. standard, that is.|Hermione's ability to perform N.E.W.T.-level magic|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Trio study.jpg|thumb|250px|The trio in the Gryffindor common room having a discussion about recent events]]
The D.A. brought Harry into greater contact with [[Cho Chang]]. After a meeting, Harry kissed Cho, and when he returned to the Gryffindor Common Room Hermione immediately guessed, asking if Cho had cornered him after the meeting. When Harry told them that Cho has been crying, she explained to Harry and Ron that Cho was having a hard time since [[Cedric Diggory]], who she used to go out with, was killed by Lord Voldemort. Hermione later gave Harry advice on Cho and girls in general. 

In an effort to combat the lies being told about Harry, Hermione arranged for an interview during a [[Hogsmeade]] [[Hogsmeade weekend trips|visit]] with [[Rita Skeeter]] to be printed in ''[[The Quibbler]]'' telling his side of the story, blackmailing Skeeter into penning it in a sympathetic tone. Despite being banned — or maybe because it was banned — it became the magazine's best-selling issue of all time.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;

It was Hermione's brilliant spell-work that ensured the security of Dumbledore's Army. She created [[Dumbledore's Army coin|coins]] enchanted with the [[Protean Charm]], an advanced spell, as a method of communication, and [[Dumbledore's Army parchment jinx|jinxed]] the club's attendance sheet to give any tattler a horrendous rash on the face, which would spell out "''SNEAK"'' in painful boils. This is exactly what happened to [[Marietta Edgecombe]], a reluctant member of the D.A., having been brought to the meetings by Cho. Shortly before Easter, Marietta finally caved under the pressure from her ministry mother who worked in the the [[Floo Regulation Panel|Floo Network Office]] and betrayed the D.A. to Umbridge. When Harry learned that they could not find a [[counter-curse]] to heal her face, he swelled with pride at Hermione's jinxing ability.

[[File:InquistorialSquadOffice.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione and [[Neville Longbottom]] being held against their will by the Inquisitorial Squad]]
Dobby the house-elf learned of this turn of events and rushed to the [[Room of Requirement]] to warn Harry and the D.A. They immediately scattered, and most members escaped, but Harry was caught by Umbridge and several Slytherin students who were members of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]]. A search of the room uncovered the parchment that each member of the D.A. had signed, headed ''Dumbledore's Army''. Finally having "proof" that Dumbledore was building an army to challenge the Ministry, Umbridge immediately contacted Cornelius Fudge. Dumbledore fled the school and Umbridge became Headmistress. Hermione was not exposed at that time, but later she was brought to Umbridge's office by the some members of the [[Inquisitorial Squad]].

Late in the fall of that year, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who had been missing for the entirety of the school year, returned to Hogwarts. Hermione, Harry, and Ron ventured down to see him immediately even though it was after curfew. Hermione was aghast at the injuries Hagrid had sustained and greatly curious as to his story. Hagrid told the trio about his mission with [[Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] to try and recruit the giants in the fight against Voldemort. They were almost caught when Umbridge called on Hagrid that night, but hid under the Invisibilty Cloak. 

[[File:Grawp Hermione.jpg|250px|thumb|Hermione forcefully telling Grawp to put her down]]
Months later, Hermione and Harry learned why Hagrid was perpetually bruised and cut; he had brought his giant half-brother [[Grawp]] back to Hogwarts, as he was getting severely bullied, and was trying to teach him human ways. After Grawp, who had the mental age of a human toddler, picked her up, Hermione forcefully told him to put him down. He subsequently became enamoured with Hermione, calling her "Hermy". It was one of the few words he could pronounce. 

=====O.W.L.s=====
{{Quote|Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday, but regretted it almost at once; she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming.|Hermione enthusiastically studding for her O.W.L.s|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Just after their class took their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]], Harry had a vision of his godfather being tortured by Voldemort in the [[Department of Mysteries]]. Hermione was worried that it was a trap and convinced Harry to try to contact Sirius before doing anything rash. To that end, she accompanied Harry in an act of solidarity as he sneaked into Umbridge's office to use the [[Floo Network]], with the assistance of Ron, Ginny, and [[Luna Lovegood]], but they were ultimately caught. When Umbridge threatened to use the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on Harry during questioning, Hermione interceded. She came up with a lie that she and her fellow D.A. members had been building a weapon for Dumbledore, thus stopping Umbridge's sadistic interrogation and attempted torture of Harry.

[[File:Normal 260ootp umbridge potter granger.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione and Harry lured Umbridge into the [[Forbidden Forest]]]]
Hermione successfully lured Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest by saying that's where the weapon was hidden, where Umbridge was carried away by a herd of [[centaur]]s. She had predicted that the centaurs would let her and Harry go, since they did not insult the centaurs and were young enough to be considered "foals". However, the centaurs were already enraged by Umbridge and were further angered when Hermione admitted that she had hoped that they would drive Umbridge off, being insulted that they were thought of to do the bidding of humans. The centaurs were about to carry the two students off as well, but [[Grawp]] stumbled onto the scene and a [[Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest|fight broke out]] between the giant and the herd. This allowed Hermione and Harry to escape and meet up with Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville, who had escaped from the [[Inquisitorial Squad]].

=====Battle of the Department of Mysteries=====
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|Voldemort knows you, Harry! He took [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] down into the [[Chamber of Secrets]] to lure you there, it's the kind of thing he does, he knows you're the — the sort of person who'd go to Sirius's aid!

After a brief argument between Harry and Neville over whether or not the others were going to travel with Harry to London, an understanding was reached. The six students flew on [[Thestral]]s (which the majority, Hermione included, could not even see) to the [[British Ministry of Magic Headquarters|Ministry of Magic]] to try to save Sirius from Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

[[File:OOTP Death Chamber trio Ginny Neville Luna.gif|250px|thumb|The six D.A. members battling Death Eaters for possession of the prophecy]]
Hermione's fear turned out to be justified, as Harry's vision was a ruse planted in his brain by Voldemort designed to lure him to the Ministry to obtain [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|a prophecy]] Voldemort sought. As soon as Harry did this, the six D.A. members were surrounded by [[Death Eaters]], and a [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries|battle]] ensued. Hermione [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] [[Nott]] when he grabbed Harry, thus freeing him and causing Nott to be injured by the [[Reductor Curse|collapsing]] shelves of prophecies. She later stunned another Death Eater and [[Silencing Charm|Silenced]] [[Antonin Dolohov]] before he could alert the other Death Eaters to the group's location. She was critically injured by the [[Antonin Dolohov's curse|curse]] Dolohov subsequently struck her with, but made a full recovery.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;

[[File:B6C6M1 inside Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione visiting [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] for the first time]]
Hermione achieved high academic prestige when she obtained ten [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]], in [[Charms (class)|Charms]], [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]], [[Care of Magical Creatures]], [[Arithmancy]], [[History of Magic]], [[Herbology]], [[Astronomy]], [[Potions (class)|Potions]], and [[Study of Ancient Runes|Ancient Runes]]. She received '[[Outstanding]]' marks on each of them, except Defence Against the Dark Arts in which she received an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]'. In total she achieved 10 O.W.L.s. Ron found it amusing that she actually seemed disappointed by this.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

=====N.E.W.T. classes=====
{{Quote|Oh, come off it. Yep — nine 'Outstandings' and one 'Exceeds Expectations' at Defence Against the Dark Arts. You're actually disappointed, aren't you?|Hermione's O.W.L. results|Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince}}
[[File:Hermione brewing Draught of Living Death.jpg|250px|thumb|Hermione brewing a [[Draught of Living Death]] in a N.E.W.T.-level Potions lesson]]
By the time they arrived in Hogwarts, Hermione's romantic feelings for Ron had become obvious. According to Harry the two seemed on their way to a romantic relationship. Hermione and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]]'s relationship suffered greatly in their sixth year, when Ron became envious of both Hermione and [[Harry Potter|Harry]], who were invited to be members of the [[Slug Club]], a group of students favoured by [[Potions (class)|Potions]] professor [[Horace Slughorn]], while he was ignored. Hermione strongly disapproved of Harry using the textbook of the "[[Severus Snape|Half-Blood Prince]]" to get ahead in [[Potions (class)|Potions]] unfairly, though she did not turn him in and indirectly found a [[Eileen Prince|clue]] about the book owner. She was particularly alarmed by the increasingly Dark nature of the magic in the book, such as the spell ''[[Sectumsempra]]''.

[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-harry hermione.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry comforting an upset Hermione after she witnessed Ron snogging Lavender]]
However, during an argument with his sister, Ginny mocked Ron about his inexperience with the opposite gender and told him that Hermione had kissed [[Viktor Krum]] during their earlier romance. Ron subsequently began treating Hermione coldly, much to her bewilderment. She was upset when he and Lavender started flirting. When she found out about Ron's relationship with Lavender, she [[Bird-Conjuring Charm|conjured a flock of wild birds]] to attack Ron for his insensitivity regarding her feelings. He became even angrier with her when she believed that Harry slipped Ron [[Felix Felicis]] to assist in his [[Quidditch]]-playing abilities; despite having believed it initially himself, he accused her of having no faith in him when it was discovered that he had not been slipped the potion at all. 

After this, Hermione attended Slughorn's [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] with [[Cormac McLaggen]] to get back at Ron, but it did not go well due to the former's impoliteness. Afterwards, Ron (who was relieved that Hermione and McLaggen's date did not go well) attempted to speak to Hermione, but she ignored him, still upset and angry over his previous treatment of her.&lt;ref name="HBP"&gt;{{HBP}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour presisted for quite sometime.

=====Reconciliation with Ron=====
{{Quote|Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened, she had taken almost no part in Harry and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]'s obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightened-looking, until at last they had been allowed in to see him.|Hermione visiting Ron in the hospital after he was poisoned|Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince}}
[[File:Poppy Pomfrey - Ron Weasley.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] checking on a poisoned Ron, while Hermione, Harry, and Ginny are sitting by his bedside]]
The two reconciled after Ron was hospitalised due to consuming poisoned mead, an event that left Hermione shaken and frightened. After the incident she remained unusually quiet and subdued. Whilst sitting at Ron's bedside, Ron subconsciously muttered Hermione's name. By this time, Ron was visibly disillusioned with his relationship with [[Lavender Brown|Lavender]], who had become possessive of him and called him by the annoying nickname "''Won-Won''". He was also pleased whenever Hermione visited him in the hospital wing. 

He began avoiding Lavender, who soon became suspicious of his relationship with Hermione, ultimately leading to an argument about her. After Lavender saw Ron and Hermione come down alone from the boys' dormitories (Harry was present also, but under the [[Cloak of Invisibility|invisibility cloak]]), she had a fight with Ron and broke up with him. When Ron told Harry and Hermione about breaking up with Lavender, Harry could have sworn he saw Hermione smirk.

[[File:Harry-potter-half-blood-textbook.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione and Ron discussing the Half-Blood Prince]]
Afterwards, Hermione and Ron were more comfortable together, and their relationship improved considerably, although a romantic relationship remained out of their reach. Hermione comforted Ron after he failed his [[Apparition (class)|Apparition]] test because he [[Splinching|Splinched]] half an eyebrow, while he teased her about the [[Wilkie Twycross|instructor]]'s praise for her flawless performance. That year, Hermione also quickly mastered [[nonverbal spell|nonverbal magic]], the first in her class to do so. 

Throughout the year, Hermione and Ron were both sceptical of Harry's theory that [[Draco Malfoy]] had been branded with the [[Dark Mark]] and was up to something. Moreover, she was confident that Malfoy couldn't have brought any Dark objects into Hogwarts without alerting [[Argus Filch|Filch]]. These claims were heard by Draco himself, who used these details and Hermione's previous plan of communication to accomplish his own.

=====Battle of the Astronomy Tower=====
{{Quote|Outside Snape's office, yes, with Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened... We didn't know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the map... It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don't think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snape's office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and — I was so stupid, Harry! He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he — while he went to help fight the Death Eaters —|Hermione's participation in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]|Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince}}
[[File:Hermione mourning Dumbledore.jpg|250px|thumb|A tearful Hermione standing at the base of the [[Astronomy Tower]] after Dumbledore's death]]
Near the end of the school year, Harry's suspicions would be proven right. Malfoy let Death Eaters into the school by means of a pair of vanishing cabinets. One cabinet resided in [[Borgin and Burkes]] and the other in the Room of Hidden Things (as it had been presumed broken, but Malfoy managed to fix it). This infiltration of [[Death Eaters]] resulted in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]. Hermione fought in the battle and remained unscathed thanks to some [[Felix Felicis]].&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; This was a gift from Harry, who had won it in a Potions competition and had a preconceived notion of what was going to happen. He told Hermione, Ron, and Ginny to drink it beforehand in case his worries proved true.

[[File:B6C30M1 funeral of Albus Dumbledore.png|250px|thumb|left|The funeral of Albus Dumbledore]]
Throughout the school year, Hermione and Ron had been informed of the content of Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore. Through these lessons Harry, and in turn Hermione and Ron, learned about the existence of Lord Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es. During the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] of [[Albus Dumbledore]], who had been killed by Snape in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Hermione was comforted by Ron and cried on his shoulder. Afterwards, Harry told them about his desire to drop out of Hogwarts to hunt Horcruxes, which were the key to defeating [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Despite his protests, Hermione and Ron promised to forgo their seventh year of school in order to assist Harry. Before leaving the school, Hermione was able to [[Summoning Charm|Summon]] books about Horcruxes so as to learn how to destroy the items. She found them in Dumbledore's office, where the late headmaster had kept them after the subject had been banned at Hogwarts.

[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-memory charm.jpg|250px|thumb|Hermione modifying her parents' memories]]
Hermione began planning for her journey with [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] immediately. Concerned for the safety of her family, she [[False memory spell|altered]] her parents' memories to make them think they were Wendell and Monica Wilkins and sent them to hide in [[Australia]], no longer aware of their original identities, the existence of their daughter, or anything she had told them about Harry. She also withdrew all of her savings at her [[building society]] account, in event of a need for Muggle money.&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{DH}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

====Battle of the Seven Potters====
{{Main|Battle of the Seven Potters}}

[[File:B7C4M1 Seven Potters depart.png|250px|thumb|left|The seven Potters and their protectors right before the sky battle]]
Hermione then joined the [[Order of the Phoenix]] in the operation to remove Harry from 4 Privet Drive before his 17th birthday, taking Polyjuice Potion to become one of the "seven Potters". Hermione flew on a [[Thestral]] with [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]. The two fought off at least five [[Death Eaters]], possibly killing one, injuring two, and were pursued by Lord Voldemort himself at one point. In time, they arrived safely at the[[the Burrow| Burrow]], where Hermione was immensely relieved to see Harry alive and ran to him and hugged him tight, but she was greatly worried when Ron did not show up on time. When he landed, she ran and nuzzled him in relief. She was saddened by the news of [[Alastor Moody]] and [[Hedwig]]'s murders and disturbed by Harry's vision of [[Garrick Ollivander]] being [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]].

[[File:DH1 HQ still Scrimgeour Trio.jpg|250px|thumb|Scrimgeour giving the trio the items left for them in Albus Dumbledore's will]]
Later on, the [[Minister for Magic]], [[Rufus Scrimgeour]], interrupted Harry's birthday celebrations to execute [[The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore's will]] and bequeath some of his belongings to the three friends. Hermione received {{TBB}}, a book of children's stories written in runes. Even before Hermione understood the priceless quality of the gift, she was moved to tears by Dumbledore's great act of friendship. During the reading of Dumbledore's will, she also displayed her incredible store of general knowledge when she mentioned that "''Snitches have flesh memories''", surprising both Ron and Harry, who had both believed her to know little to nothing of [[Quidditch]].

At Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] on 1 August, 1997, Hermione wore a "''floaty, lilac-coloured dress with matching high heels''" and made her hair "''sleek and shiny''". She was amused by [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]]'s stories about their late uncle [[Bilius]] and shared a friendly exchange with [[Viktor Krum]], to the frustration of Ron. She was happily surprised when Ron quickly asked her to dance, and when Krum asked a disguised Harry whether the two were together, Harry replied "''Er... sort of.''"&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

====Time at the Burrow====
{{Quote|Undetectable Extension Charm. Tricky, but I think I've done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here...

The wedding was interrupted by Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus who told the guests of the fall of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Hermione was prepared to make a quick escape, immediately Disapparating herself, Harry, and Ron away from the danger. Hermione also showed great foresight and magical talent when she revealed a small beaded purse on which she had placed an [[Extension Charm|Undetectable Extension Charm]]. Within it she had packed, amongst other things, clothing, a tent, healing supplies, Harry's [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]], and several useful books. They arrived on the Muggle street, [[Tottenham Court Road]], where Hermione suggested they enter a café, as a means to get out of the open.

[[File:Hermione duelling Dolohov.gif|250px|thumb|Hermione casting ''Petrificus Totalus'' on Antonin Dolohov]]
However, minutes later Hermione unknowingly triggered the [[Taboo|Taboo curse]] that was placed on Voldemort's name, and the trio were thus tracked down by [[Antonin Dolohov]] and [[Thorfinn Rowle]]. After a brief but violent [[Luchino Caffe Duel|skirmish]], the Death Eaters were subdued, and Hermione modified their memories to throw them off the scent and to maintain Ron's cover story that he was sick with [[spattergroit]] and bedridden at home. At Harry's suggestion the three then made their way safely to 12 Grimmauld Place, as they could not hide anywhere within the wizarding world.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

====Infiltrating the Ministry of Magic====
{{Dialogue|Harry Potter|This is mental.|Hermione|Completely mental.|The trio's mutual feelings on the infiltration plan|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
After learning from [[Mundungus Fletcher]] that Dolores Umbridge had Tom Riddle's mother's locket - one of the seven Horcruxes - in her possession, the trio formed a plan to infiltrate the Ministry and reclaim the locket. Hermione imbibed Polyjuice Potion and transformed to look like [[Mafalda Hopkirk]], a prominent Ministry official. She was forced to sit through the trials of [[Alderton]] and [[Mary Cattermole]], innocent Muggle-borns, right alongside Umbridge and Death Eater [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]]. Hermione tricked Umbridge into telling her about the locket, which she claimed was a Selwyn family heirloom.

[[File:Harry Potter's Patronus saving Marry Cattermole.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Harry casting his Patronus at [[Dementor]]s while in the trial courtroom, before capturing the locket]]
When Harry attacked Umbridge in a rage, their cover was blown, but she and Harry managed to free the Muggle-born prisoners and encouraged them to flee the country while Voldemort was in power. Hermione took the locket from Umbridge, replacing it with a copy using the [[Doubling Charm|Geminio]] spell. They met up with Ron again and fled the Ministry, but Yaxley grabbed onto Hermione's arm while they were Disapparating. This meant that he was unwittingly brought inside the enchantment making Grimmauld Place undetectable, and forced Hermione to use a [[Revulsion Jinx]] to free herself from him, and then to take the trio away from Grimmauld Place.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

====Ron's departure and Godric's Hollow====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Ron Weasley|What are you doing? Are you staying, or what?|Hermione|I... Yes — yes, I'm staying. Ron, we said we'd go with Harry, we said we'd help —|I get it.

[[File:Harry ron fight.gif|250px|thumb|Harry and Ron rowing before Ron abandoned the hunt]]
The locket caused great pain among the three friends due to the negative energy within. They began arguing over petty issues such as cooking, and growing moodier. The negative energy from the locket caused Ron to accuse Harry of poor leadership. They fought physically, although Hermione stopped them before they started casting spells by casting a [[Shield Charm]] between them. Ron also accused Hermione of choosing Harry over him, causing him to be jealous and feel left out by his two friends' growing friendship. He declared he was leaving and stormed out of the tent.

By the time she got rid of the shield charm, all Hermione could do was scream for him to come back, without success. Hermione then cried over Ron for more than a week after his departure, although she tried to hide it from Harry. Both were deeply saddened and hurt by their friend's departure, although Hermione more than Harry, as she cried over Ron's departure for weeks. With Ron gone, Hermione and Harry's evenings were spent in mostly silence, while they contemplated Ron's abandonment and the places Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes might be hidden.

[[File:Hermione godric's hollow.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione in Bathilda Bagshot's cottage, holding the ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'']]
Hermione and Harry soon decided to go to [[Godric's Hollow]], to see the graves of Harry's parents and to speak to historian [[Bathilda Bagshot]]. They believed Bathilda might be holding onto [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's Sword]] for Harry, as they thought Dumbledore might have left it with her as an old family friend, knowing it was the only method the trio knew for destroying a Horcrux. Hermione comforted Harry in the graveyard when they found the [[James and Lily Potter's grave|Potters' graves]]; she nuzzled her head in to the crook between his head and shoulders and conjured roses for the graves. On their way out of the graveyard they came into contact with what appeared to be Bathilda. 

The pair then went to Bathilda's house; whilst in the house they were separated. Harry witnessed a giant snake pouring from the neck of Bathilda's body and was attacked by [[Nagini]] upstairs. Nagini had been waiting for them in the guise of the old woman, whose corpse had been animated like an [[Inferius]] by Voldemort. Hermione rushed to Harry's aid and proceeded to save his life by casting a Blasting Cure, which ricocheted around the room. The two of them barely escaped before Lord Voldemort himself arrived at the cabin in an attempt to capture Harry.

[[File:Harry and Hermione in the Forest of Dean DHF1.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry and Hermione talking about Albus Dumbledore in the forest of Dean]]
Hermione [[Apparition|Apparated]] to the [[Forest of Dean]], while Harry was overcome with pain and visions of Voldemort's attack on his parents and him in 1981. She used a [[Severing Charm]] to remove the locket from Harry and healed the bite Nagini had given him with dittany. Harry's wand had also been broken in the foray, most likely by the [[Blasting Curse]] Hermione cast at Nagini. Hermione was very upset a the thought that it was her curse that broke Harry's wand. Harry was heartbroken, but not angry with her, knowing that it was an accident and that Hermione had saved his life and therefore could not hold it against her.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

====Ron's return and visit to the Lovegood House====
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione|Hand over Harry?|Ron Weasley |No deal, get out of the way, we're leaving.|Hermione and Ron refusing to hand Harry over to Voldemort|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Hermione65432.JPG|250px|thumb|left|Hermione still upset with Ron even after his return]]
Ron reunited with Harry and Hermione in the Forest of Dean, after Ron heard them talking through the [[Deluminator]] Dumbledore had left him. Ron destroyed the locket Horcrux with Godric Gryffindor's Sword, which had been left by an unknown assistant in a pool in the Forest, saving Harry's life and thus receiving forgiveness from Harry for leaving. Before he destroyed it, however, the locket revealed some of Ron's deepest fears, including that Hermione preferred Harry to him. Hermione, however, was unaware of this, as she had been in the tent while this occurred. 

Upon seeing Ron, she screamed at Ron despite Harry trying to tell her that Ron just saved his life, and punched him until Harry cast a shield charm between them with Hermione's wand. She was furious with Ron for days for his abandonment, but gradually warmed up to him again.

{{Main|Ambush at the Lovegood House}}
[[File:Xenophilius-Lovegood.png|250px|thumb|The trio speaking with Xenophilius Lovegood at his home, near the village of [[Ottery St Catchpole]]]]
The trio then travelled together to [[Xenophilius Lovegood]]'s home to ask him about the strange symbol in ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'', which Xenophilius had worn on a chain around his neck at Bill and Fleur's wedding. They had thought it to be the sign of the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Gellert Grindelwald]] after Krum recognised it at the wedding (Grindelwald being a former Durmstrang student), but Xenophilius informed them it was the symbol of the [[Deathly Hallows]]. Shortly after making this discovery, Harry realised that Luna wasn't at home, despite it being the Christmas holidays, and had been away for a long time. Xenophilius revealed to them that Luna had been taken prisoner by Death Eaters and that he planned to betray them in order to get her back.

[[File:Ambush at Lovegood house1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Death Eaters ambushing the trio while they were inside the Lovegood home]]
However, in attempting to capture them, Xenophilius made the [[Erumpent]] horn in his living room (which he had insisted was a Snorkack horn, much to Hermione's annoyance) explode, giving the trio the chance to hide just as Death Eaters [[Selwyn]] and [[Travers]] arrived. They threatened to kill Luna if they found that Xenophilius had lied about Harry Potter's presence in his home. In a remarkable show of mental and magical dexterity, Hermione concocted the trio's escape while safeguarding Ron's feigned illness and allowing the Death Eaters to glimpse Harry, so that they would not carry out their threat to kill Luna.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

====Skirmish at Malfoy Manor====
{{Quote|You're lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at Gringotts!... What else did you take? Tell me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife! What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! ''CRUCIO''! How did you get into my vault? Did that dirty little [[goblin]] in the cellar help you?|Overheard parts of Hermione's brutal interrogation|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
In the spring of 1998, Harry accidentally triggered the Taboo curse and Hermione, Harry, and Ron were tracked down and captured by a group of [[Snatchers]], which included the [[werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]]. Greyback had developed cannibalistic tendencies when out of werewolf form and was eager to bite Hermione. After a brief and violent interrogation by the Snatchers, the captives were brought to Malfoy Manor and turned over to [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Bellatrix immediately panicked at the sight of Godric Gryffindor's Sword and incapacitated the Snatchers with ease, as she was too quick for them. She then ordered them moved to the courtyard where she would deal with them later.

[[File:Harry-potter-deathly-hallows1-movie-screencaps.com-14694.jpg|250px|thumb|Bellatrix Lestrange torturing Hermione in Malfoy Manor]]
Bellatrix gave away that what she believed to be the sword and another Horcrux were hidden in her vault at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] in her panic. She proceeded to isolate Hermione and then brutally torture her with the [[Cruciatus Curse]] repeatedly along with taking a dagger and cutting the word Mudblood into her arm as interrogation methods. Ron (who had tried to take her place unsuccessfully) was reduced to sobs from hearing Hermione scream in pain. However, Hermione came up with a fake story that the sword was merely a copy of the real thing; a lie that Harry persuaded the imprisoned goblin [[Griphook]] to go along with.  

Hermione was soon tortured into unconsciousness. With Hermione's moans and screams of pain echoing throughout the manor, Harry and Ron saw no possible hope left. Suddenly, [[Dobby]] came to the rescue of the prisoners in the dungeon, with audible crack as he apparated. Harry and Ron fought off [[Peter Pettigrew]], who had been sent to investigate the noise. Harry snarled at him that Pettigrew owed him for Harry's sparing of his life with Lupin and Sirius, and the momentary relaxing of Pettigrew as a result caused him to be choked to death by his own silver hand (created by Voldemort) for showing Harry mercy.

They raced upstairs and were forced to drop their wands when Bellatrix held a silver knife to Hermione's throat. Bellatrix cut through some skin, leaving a thin cut on the front of Hermione's neck. Right when Bellatrix was about to slit her throat, [[Dobby]] returned and sent the chandelier crashing to the floor, knocking Bellatrix over and enabling Harry to grab their wands from Draco and [[Apparition|Disapparate]] with Hermione, Ron, Griphook, and Dobby to [[Shell Cottage]], where Bill and Fleur Weasley took up residence after their marriage. Unfortunately, Dobby was killed during this escape, by a knife Bellatrix threw.

[[File:Harry-potter7-shell cottage.jpg|250px|thumb|The trio speaking with [[Griphook]] about what lay within the Lestrange vault]]
Hermione, Harry, and Ron stayed at Shell Cottage for some time, whilst Fleur helped Hermione recover from her trauma. Ron didn't leave Hermione's bedside throughout this time. The trio formed a plan to break into the [[Lestrange Vault]] at Gringotts to retrieve the Horcrux [[Hufflepuff's Cup|Helga Hufflepuff's Cup]], with the reluctant assistance of Griphook. The goblin only agreed to help them in exchange for Gryffindor's Sword; although lothe to lose it, Hermione was strongly against deceiving or double-crossing Griphook, who was startled by the care she and Harry had shown for house-elves,since most wizards do not think highly of non-human beings. The trio reluctantly agreed to Griphook's terms.

[[File:Break-in 1998.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Ron and Hermione, disguised as Dragomir Despard and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]]]
Once more, Hermione used Polyjuice Potion, containing Bellatrix's hair. She was also forced to use [[Bellatrix Lestrange's first wand|Bellatrix's wand]], as her wand had been confiscated by [[Snatchers]]. She very much disliked this, as the wand in question had caused so much suffering, such as contributing to Sirius' murder. She stated that the wand felt wrong and Harry speculated that it was because Hermione had not won the wand's intelligence.

It was determined that Hermione was "too polite" to really impersonate Bellatrix, as she did not treat those around her like scum. Despite this, the group managed to get into the vault, mainly because of Harry's use of the [[Imperius Curse]]. After many harrowing challenges, and Griphook betraying them out of a belief that they would not have kept to their agreement, Hermione, Ron, and Harry escaped on the back of the [[dragon|half-blind dragon]] that was guarding the vault, with another Horcrux in their possession.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

====[[Battle of Hogwarts]]====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Oi! There's a war going on here!|Ron Weasley|I know, mate, so it's now or never, isn't it?|Hermione and Ron sharing a passionate kiss during the final battle|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Harry-potter7-movie-screencaps.com-6084.jpg|250px|thumb|Hermione and Ron destroying the cup in the Chamber of Secrets]]
The trio finally returned to Hogwarts on 2 May 1998, with the assistance of [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], after Harry had a vision that the remaining Horcrux they had not identified (but suspected was something formerly belonging to [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]) was hidden at the school. They were reunited with their friends in the reformed Dumbledore's Army, who declared their wish to fight the encroaching Death Eater army. Whilst Harry and Luna went to Ravenclaw Tower, Hermione and Ron retrieved [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]] fangs from the [[Chamber of Secrets]] in order to use them to destroy Horcruxes, and Hermione destroyed [[Hufflepuff's Cup]].

Soon after reuniting with Harry, Ron expressed concern for the [[house-elf|house-elves]] in the Hogwarts kitchens, prompting Hermione to kiss him for the very first time. Ron responded with great enthusiasm, but they quickly broke apart when Harry reminded them of their objective.

[[File:Fiend fyre Fleeing GIF.gif|250px|thumb|left|Hermione and Ron running from the towering flames of [[Fiendfyre]]]]
The trio then entered the [[Room of Requirement]] in search for Rowena Ravenclaw's [[Ravenclaw's Diadem|Diadem]], but were ambushed by [[Draco Malfoy]], [[Gregory Goyle]], and [[Vincent Crabbe]]. Hermione dodged a [[Killing Curse]] and managed to stun Goyle, and then she and Ron dragged him out of the room on a broomstick as it went up in flames due to Crabbe's cursed [[Fiendfyre]], which also destroyed the Horcrux. Harry rescued Draco, but Crabbe was killed by his creation. 

Harry, Hermione and Ron then witnessed the death of [[Fred Weasley]], which devastated them all. Despite their grief, the trio continued with the effort to track down Nagini, the last Horcrux (that they knew of). On their way, Hermione incapacitated two [[Death Eaters]] who were pursuing her, Harry and Ron, and blasted [[Fenrir Greyback]] away from an injured [[Lavender Brown]]. Lavender unfortunately still tragically died afterwards from her injuries.

The trio was swarmed by Dementors and all had difficulty summoning their Patronuses because of the horror of their recent experiences, but Luna, [[Ernest Macmillan|Ernie Macmillan]], and [[Seamus Finnigan]] came to their assistance. Under Harry's Invisibility Cloak, the three made their way to the [[Shrieking Shack]], where they witnessed Voldemort have Nagini kill Severus Snape, as he had (ultimately incorrectly) assumed that the Elder Wand's loyalty lay with Snape.

During the brief pause in fighting, when Voldemort issued an ultimatum to Harry, Hermione comforted [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] over Fred's death. When Voldemort and his army approached with a supposedly dead Harry, Hermione screamed in horror and denial.

[[File:B7C36M2 Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|Hermione witnessing Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort]]
The Battle of Hogwarts soon resumed, and Hermione fought [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] alongside Ginny and Luna, despite being hindered by using Bellatrix's own wand against her. When Bellatrix nearly killed Ginny, [[Molly Weasley]] took over the fight and killed Bellatrix. Hermione witnessed Harry's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, and she and Ron reached him first, overjoyed. Hermione survived the battle relatively unscathed, only suffering minor injuries and burns she received from entering the Lestranges' Vault shortly before the battle.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

===After Hogwarts {{C|1998–2018}}===
[[File:Hermione &amp; Ron with their children at platform nine and three quarters.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione with her husband and two children]]
At some point Hermione found her parents in Australia and restored their memories. In 1998, Hermione went back to Hogwarts to attain her [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]].&lt;ref&gt;PotterCast 130&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only one of the trio to do this, as Harry and Ron opted to join the Auror department and help round up remaining Death Eaters. By returning to Hogwarts she demonstrated how important schooling was to her. 

[[File:Player meeting Hermione MA.png|250px|thumb|right|Hermione meeting the student]]
On [[19 September]] [[2010]], her birthday, Hermione went back to Hogwarts in reminiscence. She visited the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] and met an [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|unidentified student]]. She noticed the book they were holding and told her story that involved it.&lt;ref name="MA"&gt;{{MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[2017]] (nineteen years later) Hermione and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] were married with two children: [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley]]. She had several nieces and nephews through her marriage to Ron. Hermione was also the godmother of [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]]'s eldest child, [[James Potter II|James Sirius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mugglenet.com/app/news/full_story/1414 Video clip of J.K.

====Ministry of Magic employee====
{{Quote|Hermione began her post-Hogwarts career at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures where she was instrumental in greatly improving life for house-elves and their ilk.

K. Rowling]] regarding Hermione's future|Bloomsbury Live Chat}}
[[File:HogwartsHeroesJoinMinistry.png|200px|thumb|left|Newspaper report on the trio joining the Ministry]]
Hermione attained a high position in the Ministry of Magic, first through the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]. There, she continued her work with [[Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare|S.P.E.W.]], working for the rights of underprivileged non-humans such as house-elves. She then went on to become Deputy Head&lt;ref name="dumbledores-army-reunites" /&gt; of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and assisted the [[Minister for Magic]] [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] in eradicating the old laws biased in favour of [[pure-blood]]s. Along with Harry and Ron, she helped to revolutionise the Ministry and reform the wizarding world. At some point, Hermione, Harry, and Ron were all featured on [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s for their accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliophilists.wordpress.com/2007/10/22/highlights-of-jk-rowlings-us-book-tour/ J.K. Rowling's U.S. Book Tour]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermione also eventually translated ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'' from the original, which had been written in runes and which [[Albus Dumbledore]] bequeathed to her in his will in 1997. Her new translation was published in 2008 and included notes on each tale written by Dumbledore before his death; these notes were lent to Hermione by her former professor, Hogwarts Headmistress [[Minerva McGonagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{TBB|R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Hermione and Ron attended the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]] and sat in VIP Box Two. Rita Skeeter noted that Ron had become catatonic at the appearance of the Bulgarian Veela and Hermione had to elbow him in the ribs.

On [[1 September]] [[2017]], Hermione and Ron brought their children to [[King's Cross Station]] to see Rose off for her first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and met Harry, Ginny, and their three children there.

===Minister for Magic {{C|2019-}}===
{{Quote|What can I say? My parents were dentists, I was bound to rebel at some point. Forty is leaving it a little late, but... You've just done a brilliant thing. You're certainly not being told off — I just need you to look at your paperwork every now and again, that's all. Consider this a gentle — nudge — from the Minister for Magic.|Minister Granger reminding Harry to do his paperwork|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child}}
At some point between [[2019]] and [[2020]], Hermione was elected as [[Minister for Magic]].&lt;ref name="Minister"&gt;[[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] was still Minister when the [[Calamity]] started in [[June]] [[2019]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2020, Hermione had to visit Harry to ask him to complete his paperwork and the other tasks he was yet to do. She talked about her concerns for recent activity similar to ones which happened when Voldemort was alive. Harry reminded her that he did just find a [[Time-Turner]] and he would get round to the rest of the tasks in his own time. They agreed that the Time-Turner should be destroyed and Hermione hid it away.

A few months later, Hermione was returning to her office when she was stopped by Ron, who was really [[Albus Potter]] transfigured to look like Ron. Albus was trying to stall her while [[Scorpius Malfoy]] and [[Delphini|Delphi]] stole the Time-Turner. Hermione found Ron annoying although he stalled her long enough for the others to find the Time-Turner and they left.

Hermione had found out about Harry's nightmares and how his scar was hurting again and she called a meeting. However, no one thought it was a threat.

[[File:Ron Hermione cursed child.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Hermione and Ron standing in her office at the [[Ministry of Magic]]]]
Hermione's life was changed by Albus and Scorpius when they meddled with time. In one [[alternate reality]], she did not marry Ron and became the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. In another alternate reality where Harry died, Hermione was in hiding as a member of what remained of [[Dumbledore's Army]] with Ron and [[Severus Snape]]. When Scorpius turned up with information about the original timeline where they won, Hermione agreed to help put time right again by time-travelling to the moment Scorpius changed time and use a [[Shield Charm]] to stop him. Hermione was the one to use the charm first, but when they returned to the present, it was still changed. They were attacked by Dementors and Hermione and Ron professed their love for each other and sacrificed their souls to the [[Dementor]]s to give Scorpius time to escape.

[[File:The-Australian-company-of-Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Child.-Photo-Matt-Murphy. 1537-1140x800.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Hermione Granger as a Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in the alternate timeline]]
When time was right again, Hermione visited Hogwarts to attend a meeting with Professor McGonagall. Hermione, along with Ron, Harry, Ginny and Draco were very forgiving of what Albus and Scorpius did, but McGonagall reminded them of great dangers that happened, and could still have been, because they meddled with time.

When Albus and Scorpius were kidnapped by Delphi and made to travel in time again to [[31 October]] [[1981]], Hermione travelled in time again with Ron, Harry, Ginny and Draco Malfoy to save them. Hermione helped transfigure Harry to look like Voldemort to trick Delphi who hopes to save him, and then later helped Harry duel Delphi. She and Draco then apprehended her and took her back to the present where she was sent to [[Azkaban]].

====The Calamity====
During the [[Calamity]], Hermione acted as one of the apparent leading members of the newly-created [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] and would introduce members who had proven to be qualified to Professions after complimenting on their impressive combination of determination and ability. She would also help the members personally, instructing those who pursued a professorship on the Proficiency Charm after returning from a sojourn overseas while giving Aurors a retrospective regarding her experiences in the Second Wizarding War to help them in fighting Death Eaters.

=====The Unforgivables=====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione|I understand that you're trying to send The Unforgivable a message, but are you sure taking action without discussing the possible consequences first was smart? Their "suggestion" to stop meddling with the Calamity didn't contain any specific threats, but I doubt they'll let this slide...|Harry Potter|I'm not afraid of The Unforgivable, but I am afraid of what could happen if they're allowed unfettered access to the Calamity. By the time we made a decision on what to do, who knows what they might've unleashed? There's a good chance their threat was just a bluff anyway.|I don't know, Harry, The Unforgivable doesn't seem like the kind of group to make empty threats. I just hope we don't find that out firsthand...|Harry and Hermione discussing the Unforgivable and the threat it posed|Harry Potter: Wizards Unite}}
In the spring of [[2021]], The Unforgivable threatened Harry Potter and Hermione after the two began wrenching control of Calamity surges away from the cabal. The two feared that their children would be targeted, but Harry insisted on continuing to fight against the Unforgivable. Harry redirected a Calamity surge and controlled it using memories of the [[Marauders]]. When [[Minerva McGonagall]] was uncharacteristically late in reporting to the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force|SOS Task Force]], Constance Pickering, Harry Potter, and Hermione Granger feared she had been attacked. By [[April]], it became apparent that while Minerva was unharmed, Ginny had been attacked and Ron had been abducted.&lt;ref name="WU Marauders2"&gt;{{WU}} - [[Brilliant Event: The New Marauders]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their attack on Harry's wife and Hermione's husband, the Unforgivable unleashed a surge of [[Dragon]] [[Registry: Adversaries Events|Adversaries]]. While this was disastrous, it allowed Harry to tap into somebody's memory of being forced to abduct Ron.&lt;ref name="WU Adversaries2"&gt;{{WU}} - [[Registry: Adversaries Events]]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the Unforgivable unleashed a surge of Foundables related to [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] where Ron worked. While the Unforgivable succeeded in intimidating Harry and Hermione, Harry even enlisted the help of [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] in the hopes of finding his best friend, this attack only made Hermione even more determined to bring the cabal to justice.&lt;ref name="WU Weasley2"&gt;{{WU}} - [[Brilliant Event: A Weasley Predicament]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Unforgivable began a campaign of harassment and manipulation to secure their position preceding negotiations for Ron's returns, including implanting false memories in [[Molly Weasley]] of Ron crying and begging her to tell Harry and Hermione to listen to the Unforgivable so that he could return home. Molly instead instructed Hermione to "''give them Hell''".&lt;ref name="AWP2"&gt;{{WU}} - [[Brilliant Event: A Weasley Predicament]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of April, the Unforgivable had delivered their list of demands via notes dispatched within Foundables. In exchange for Ron's safe return, they not only wanted full command of the Calamity but for London Five victim [[Kit Gerrard]] and the defector informant [[Flavius Flint]] to be delivered to them. Hermione decided that she and Constance should use Polyjuice Potion to take the places of Gerrard and Flint as a means to infiltrate the Unforgivable, with Harry delivering them in exchange for Ron. It seemed the Unforgivable were aware of this deception, as well as where the Ministry's defences were weakest, however.

Whilst [[duelling]] against members of the cabal, Constance was hit with a [[Blasting Curse]] but luckily came away with only mild burns. While Ron was recovering, albeit unconscious, the real Flavius and Kit were taken. When Constance returned from having her injuries healed at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], she reported that Ron had woken up and his memories had been completely [[Memory Charm|Obliviated]], to the point where he could not even recognise his wife.&lt;ref name="WU Adversaries2" /&gt; Hermione wondered if everything, including rescuing Ron, had been part of the cabal's plans all along. She and Harry considered the possibility of a mole in the Ministry or a [[Legilimency|Legilimens]] among the Unforgivable's ranks.&lt;ref name="AWP2" /&gt;

In May 2021, Calamity surges surrounding baby magical creatures created the impression that the Unforgivable were involved in illegal poaching and trading of rare beasts. Fragments of a note apparently from Grim Fawley contained co-ordinates to a location in Cape Town, to where Harry Potter led a team of Aurors in order to stop a potential auction, and to find members of the cabal. Unfortunately, no auction took place, adding weight to the theory of a mole in the Ministry. The return of Mountain Troll and Acromantula fragments caused Ron Weasley to remember events from his past, though he still could not remember the names of people close to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brilliant Event: Creature Discomforts]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Hermione resorted to drugging various Ministry members with Truth Serum then erasing their memories of being interrogated by her. This method outed [[Gareth Greengrass]] as not only the mole but a high ranking member of the Unforgivable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brilliant Event: Unforgivable Truth]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermione hoped that the detention of Gareth Greengrass would put a stop to the appearance of Adversaries, however instead the SOS Taskforce was inundated with an unprecedented surge of all known Feared Adversaries over the course of a week (14-21 July 2021). Hermione speculated that perhaps Greengrass was capable of manipulating the Calamity without a wand, though Constance thought it might be that Greengrass was not the one responsible. Hermione also claimed that "''anyone who could bring Darkness like this into the world must be capable of powerful magic''".&lt;ref&gt;{{WU}} (All Feared Adversaries Event)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his detention, Gareth Greengrass repeatedly proclaimed innocence and his colleagues in the [[Department of Mysteries]] called for his release, even going so far as to accuse Harry and Hermione of using the [[Imperius Curse]] to obtain a false confession. As testimony procured under [[Veritaserum]] was inadmissible and there was no paper trail or actual evidence of Greengrass's involvement with the Unforgivable, Hermione turned her attention to helping Ron recover his memories of the [[1992–1993 school year]]. During this time, an Auror discovered that Gareth's strange habit of delivering Interdepartmental Memos via owl was part of a ruse. Gareth's owl was a Transfigured potions cabinet containing Polyjuice Potion. When tested, those who imbibed the potions turned into Hermione  and the editor-in-chief of the ''Daily Prophet'', linking Gareth Greengrass to the abductions of Ginny and Ron. A complication arose, however, when it became apparent one of the Polyjuice Potions had been tampered with during the month that Gareth was detained. Hermione concluded that this was part of an escape attempt and alerted Harry.&lt;ref&gt;{{WU}} - [[Brilliant Event: Secrets Revealed]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gareth Greengrass was eventually caught out and taken into custody in an official capacity, but remained tight-lipped until Harry rose the issue of Gareth's daughter. It was discovered that Cereus Greengrass suffered a blood malediction. Gareth and Harry formed an [[Unbreakable Vow]], sealed by Constance Pickering, whereby Harry would find a cure for Gareth's daughter and in turn Gareth would help Harry uncover the identities of the Unforgivable. Harry visited [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] and placed a large donation, securing special care for Cereus. By the time he returned, however, Gareth Greengrass was dead. During these events, Hermione contemplated the likelihood of Gareth hiding information in their conversations, and concluded that Penelope Fawley might be trapped in an image much like Kit Gerrard had been. She went to check a photograph of Grim and Penelope that was on Gareth's desk, only to find it had gone missing. A mysterious male figure was implicated but not identified.&lt;ref name="prisoners"&gt;{{WU}} - [[Brilliant Event: Prisoner of the Vow]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
[[File:Hermione Granger OOTP profile.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Hermione in her fifth year]]
Hermione had light skin, bright brown eyes, lots of bushy brown hair (once described as a ''"long mane of brown hair"''),&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; and — as a child — rather large front teeth.&lt;ref name="hair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eyes" /&gt;  She possessed a "bossy sort of voice" that would become slightly shrill when she was angry.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;

Hermione generally wore her school uniform under her robes. Otherwise, she dressed casually. She usually kept her hair long and sometimes tied it back in a plait.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Hermione never gave much attention to her appearance, usually hiding her potential to be considered extremely pretty under her bushy hairstyle and a large pile of books, which she kept slung on her back.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt;
[[File:Hermione Deathly Hallows.jpg|left|thumb|249x249px|Hermione in her seventh and final year]]
In [[1994]], after Hermione was accidentally struck with a ''[[Densaugeo]]'' spell, [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] magically [[Shrinking Charm|shrank]] her front teeth and told Hermione to alert her when her teeth had returned to their original size. Hermione deviously let the spell continue a little longer, evening them out and making it unnecessary for her to receive the braces that [[Hermione Granger's parents|her parents]] — both dentists — had originally intended for her. Hermione later confessed that she had previously considered fixing her teeth with magic but resisted out of respect for her parents.  

During the [[Yule Ball]], Hermione revealed that when she put her mind to it, she could look truly beautiful — she used [[Sleekeazy's Hair Potion]] to fix her hair, making it sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She wore robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she held herself differently. Harry himself failed to recognise her initially, and was shocked when he did, for she didn't look at all like her usual self. Even Pansy Parkinson gaped at Hermione when she saw her, and Draco seemed unable to find an insult to throw at her.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; A similar transformation was seen during the wedding of Bill and Fleur — her hair was again "''sleek and shiny''", and she wore a floaty, lilac-coloured dress with matching high heels.

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b-a-c|Horace Slughorn|Oho! 'One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she's the best in our year!'

Oh, Harry!|After Hermione impresses [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]] with her knowledge|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Hermione reading.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Hermione was known to read for recreation and for fun]]
Hermione was noted for being both extremely intellectual curious and very hard-working, coming out on top in most of her classes and continuously aiding Harry and Ron in their adventures. She was so studious that the Ministry allowed her a [[Time-Turner]] in her third year, a device that rewinds time so that she could take extra courses.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; Because of her efficiency and compassion, Hermione often had time to do hobby work on the side, such as preparing a defence for [[Buckbeak]] to save him from execution and creating [[Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare|S.P.E.W.]], an organisation promoting the freedom of [[House-elf|house-elves]].&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; Such acts demonstrated her social conscience and tenacity.

{{Quote|That's what Hermione does. When in doubt, go to the library.|Ron's opinion of Hermione's personality|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Hermione with her Hand Up.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Hermione's enthusiasm in class]]
Unlike most wizards who depended solely on their magical ability, Hermione readily relied on logic, which often helped her to cleverly deduce information that many others missed, such as [[Remus Lupin]]'s [[Werewolf|lycanthropy]].&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; However, her emphasis on logic made her sceptical about accepting anything without proof, as opposed to Harry who would come to intuitive conclusions, such as completely dismissing the idea of the [[Deathly Hallows]], refusing to believe in them without physical evidence.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Hermione's logic had limits, putting her beliefs before all else at the same time in a way that made her ignore reality when it contradicted what she believed, no matter how strong or overwhelming the evidence was. An example of this was the reality of the house-elves, she insisted that they wanted to be free, have wages and only seemed happy because they were under educated and brainwashed when her friends told her that they like their lot in life even after the elves themselves told her they were happy and didn't want her help because they don't usually think the way humans do.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; Even though Hermione knew a lot about the [[wizarding world]], she was not well informed about the children's culture of the wizarding world until Albus Dumbledore gave her his [[Hermione Granger's copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard|copy of ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'']], as she grew up in a Muggle household and did not know she was a witch until her pre-teens.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

Hermione was quite blunt with her opinions, sometimes to the point of being tactless. For example, her attempt to comfort [[Lavender Brown]] about the death of her [[Binky|rabbit]] did not go over well,&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; and her honesty when dealing with [[centaur]]s in 1996 nearly landed her and Harry in serious trouble.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; Despite this, Hermione was generally sensitive to others' emotions and would lie when she had to, though she wasn't a skilled liar.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; She also gave her friends advice rather often, such as in trying to make Harry understand Cho Chang's behaviour on their date,&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; and in helping Ginny deal with her crush on Harry.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; These actions once prompted Ron to advise her to write a book to translate all the "mad things" girls do so that boys could understand them.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;

{{Quote|Hermione's immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room, several tables spread with books, [[Arithmancy (class)|Arithmancy]] charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted.|Hermione's intense workload starts to weight on her|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
Hermione was very responsible, a strict perfectionist and well put-together who often attempted to act as the voice of reason among her more impulsive friends, to varying levels of success. These traits led to her being made a prefect during her fifth year. Throughout her entire school career, Hermione was insistent on order and steadfastly devoted to the rules, often at the expense of her popularity. Her sense of humour was limited, frequently expressing disapproval over [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]]'s practical jokes and threatened to put them in detention for selling prank items in the common room.

In spite of her strait-laced disposition, she wasn't above using coercion and threats to get what she wanted, achieve results or protect herself and those she cared about in the long run. This is evidenced by her blackmailing Rita Skeeter into writing a good article about Harry,&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; as well as slapping Draco Malfoy when he insulted Hagrid and drawing her wand on him, using a Confundus Charm on Cormac McLaggen for insulting her friends and placing a jinx on the list of DA members that would cause them to sprout boils all over their face in the word "SNEAK" if they betrayed the organisation. Malfoy, Rita Skeeter and Marietta Edgecombe all served as examples of what could result if they pushed the most talented witch of her generation one inch too far.

Because of her opinionated, interfering nature, Hermione had the reputation for being a bossy know-it-all. Her sometimes abrasive attitude masked deep insecurities and fear of failure, as personified by her [[Boggart]].&lt;ref name="JKRHG"&gt;[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=8 Extra Stuff: Hermione Granger] on {{JKRS}}&lt;/ref&gt; She felt the need to prove herself, perhaps partly because of how many people in wizarding society looked down on Muggle-borns. However, she didn't let anyone bully her about this and ignored bigots like Draco Malfoy. Despite her growing confidence in her abilities, Hermione wasn't arrogant or conceited, and helped her classmates with their schoolwork whenever she could. In her fifth year, she also became one of the few people to call Voldemort by name.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;

Though she initially showed a tendency toward mild panic in sudden situations,&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; in time she was able to overcome this trait of hers, and demonstrated her bravery and extreme loyalty to her friends many times when facing danger, risking her life frequently to help them and standing by Harry even when no one else did. Although she wasn't as short-tempered as her friends, Hermione displayed a formidable fury on several occasions, such as slapping Draco Malfoy in defence of Hagrid,&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; sabotaging Cormac McLaggen's tryout as a [[Keeper]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] after he insulted Ron and Ginny, conjuring a flock of canaries to attack Ron in their sixth year&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; and physically attacking him when he briefly abandoned her and Harry during their hunt for Horcruxes.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; She also tended to be rather argumentative, a trait most evident in her interactions with Ron.

==Magical abilities and skills==

{{Quote|An' they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can' do.|[[Rubeus Hagrid]] praising Hermione's outstanding magical talents|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

Hermione proved to be an extremely powerful and talented young [[Wizardkind|witch]]. Even before she began her education at Hogwarts, she practised some simple [[spell]]s which all worked.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; [[Remus Lupin]] claimed that Hermione was the cleverest witch of her age he had ever met.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; Her magical capability easily surpassed almost every single student in her year, challenged only by a select few.

{{Quote|One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she's the best in our year.|[[Harry Potter]] addressing Hermione's magical aptitude|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
{{Quote|I've tried a few simple [[spell]]s just for practice and it's all worked for me.|Hermione addressing her own impressive magical competence and knowledge at a young age|harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
*'''[[Magic]]al aptitude''': At Hogwarts, Hermione was usually the first to master any spell and could use spells beyond her educational level.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; She earned ten [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]]; nine '[[Outstanding]]s', and one '[[Exceeds Expectations]]', in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Harry Potter was the strongest student in that subject,&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; but even Harry acknowledged that Hermione was "the best in our year," and repeatedly admired her spell work.
*'''[[Wandless magic|Wandless]] and [[Nonverbal spell|nonverbal magic]]''': Hermione became highly skilled at [[nonverbal spell|non-verbal magic]] in her sixth year, being the first to succeed at it in her [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class and quickly becoming so good at non-verbal [[incantation]]s that she did not need to say the incantations aloud for a wide variety of [[spell]]s.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; She was known to have practised [[wandless magic]] in her years at Hogwarts. Hermione did not need the aid of a [[wand]] or magical instrument for a wide variety of spells.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

[[File:Download.gif|250px|thumb|Hermione and Ron casting the [[Stunning Spell]] at [[Death Eaters]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]]]
[[File:Tumblr m3f7mtfdjZ1qgt0vro6 250.gif|250px|thumb|Hermione blasting [[Fenrir Greyback]], after he killed Lavender Brown during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]]]

*'''[[Duelling]]''': Hermione demonstrated her exemplary abilities in [[martial magic]] on numerous occasions, showing remarkable [[duelling]] skill for her age. She had very fast reflexes when it came to wand work; for instance, she drew her wand and placed a [[Shield Charm]] between Harry and Ron when they were quarrelling before either of them could even draw their wands in [[1997]], and when the trio was spotted by Death Eaters during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], she was the first to react, sending them to safety.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Her duelling style was creative and unpredictable, mixing non-combat spells along with more conventional combative spells to overcome her opponents. Although she was incapacitated relatively early in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], Hermione removed two [[Death Eaters]] from the fight in that short time.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; By the time she accompanied Ron and Harry on the search for the Horcruxes, her spell-work was swifter than opponents such as [[Mundungus Fletcher]]: Hermione defeated [[Antonin Dolohov]] and [[Gregory Goyle]], [[Blasting Curse|blasted]] [[Nagini]] to defend Harry,&lt;ref name="DH17" /&gt; repelled [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]] when he forcibly [[Apparition|Disapparated]] with her, blasted [[Fenrir Greyback]] away from an injured [[Lavender Brown]], and saved him and Ron from being apprehended by Death Eaters when the trio went to see [[Xenophilius Lovegood]]. She defeated many Death Eaters during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and held her own against [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] with the assistance of [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] and [[Luna Lovegood]]. They weren't able to defeat her, but this likely because Hermione was fighting at a great disadvantage: she was forced to fight Bellatrix with Bellatrix's own wand, that was still loyal to Bellatrix. Being able to hold her own in such a disadvantageous condition against a very powerful witch like Bellatrix was an exceptional feat, further proof of her duelling ability.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

[[File:Mione_obliate.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Hermione erasing [[Antonin Dolohov]]'s memories]]

*'''[[Charm]]s''': Hermione was exceptionally talented with charm-work and some of her most impressive magical feats were charms. In her first year, she effortlessly mastered the [[Levitation Charm]] in Charms class, and also quickly learnt how to cast other charms such as the [[Unlocking Charm]] and [[Flashing paint charm]] without difficulty.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; She not only achieved an '[[Outstanding]]' [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; but also received a hundred and twelve percent in her first year Charms exam.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; Hermione enchanted her [[Hermione Granger's beaded handbag|small handbag]] with an [[Extension Charm|Undetectable Extension Charm]] to allow her to carry more items in the bag than physically allowed, which allowed her, Harry and Ron to survive the months spent out in the open.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; She managed to cast the [[Memory Charm]] successfully multiple times after having only read the theory behind it, affecting [[Antonin Dolohov]] and [[Thorfinn Rowle]] even when they were subjected to the [[Cruciatus Curse]].&lt;ref name="DH9"&gt;{{DH|B|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her sixth year, she successfully cast the [[Confundus Charm]] on Cormac McLaggen.&lt;ref name="HBP11"&gt;{{HBP|B|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her array of [[Protego totalum|protective charms]] she casted outside their defended her, Harry, and Ron for almost a year while they were searching for Voldemort's Horcruxes, while several far more experienced wizards were captured within months.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Hermione's speciality was creating [[Bluebell Flames|portable, waterproof fires]]. In her first year, she kept these fires in a jar, used them to distract Severus Snape, whom she thought was jinxing Harry's broom during his first Quidditch match, and to attack the [[Devil's Snare]] when she, Harry, and Ron searched for the Philosopher's Stone.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; In her second year, she used her flames in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom to light the cauldron above one of the toilets while Polyjuice Potion was brewed so that Harry and Ron could interrogate Draco Malfoy about the Heir of Slytherin.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; During the [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|Horcrux hunt]], she kept the flames in a jar to keep the trio warm during winter.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; However, the one charm she had trouble with was the Patronus Charm, something Harry noted when she tried casting it when he, she and Ron infiltrated the Ministry of Magic, perhaps indicating she lacked the self-confidence.&lt;ref name="DH13" /&gt; That said, she learned how to cast the corporeal Patronus Charm in her [[1995–1996 school year|fifth year]] and was the first to master the advanced spell in Dumbledore's Army under Harry's tutelage, hers taking the form of an [[otter]].&lt;ref name="OOTP27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DH13" /&gt; She mentioned in [[1997]] that she had been practising how to use her Patronus for messaging,&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; but it is unknown if she ever actually carried this out.

[[File:Hermione conjuring flowers GIF.gif|250px|thumb|Hermione conjuring a wreath of flowers in [[Godric's Hollow]], [[Christmas]] [[1997]]]]

*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Hermione was particularly talented in transfiguration. She was the first in her class to succeed at transfiguring a [[Match to needle spell|match into a needle]] in their first lesson, long before any other student.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; In 1994, she was the only one able to transform a [[Hedgehog to pincushion spell|Hedgehog to a pincushion]]. Hermione earned an '[[Outstanding]]' in her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam, learning to [[Vanishment|vanish]] objects, one of its hardest spells. In 1995, she was able to [[Vanishing Spell|vanish]] Harry Potter's [[potion]] after believing him to be finished with it and a kitten by mid-year - the hardest vanishment challenge of all. Hermione was very skilled at [[conjuration]], an advanced type of transfiguration. In her sixth year, she was able to conjure [[Bird-Conjuring Charm|a flock of canaries]].&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; By the [[1997|next year]], she could conjure a wreath of flowers (likely with ''[[Bouquet Spell|Orchideous]]'') and a [[Flask-conjuring spell|flask]] [[Nonverbal spell|non-verbally]]. Hermione could also perform [[Human Transfiguration]], which is noted to be very difficult and did so in [[1998]] to disguise Ron during the [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)|break-in at Gringotts Bank]]. She could also cast various other transfiguration spells, such as the [[Lapifors Spell]], [[Draconifors Spell]], [[Snufflifors Spell]], [[Avifors Spell]], ''[[Ducklifors]]'', ''[[Pullus]]'' and ''[[Vermiculus]]''.&lt;ref name="POAG"&gt;{{POA|G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GOFG"&gt;{{GOF|G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Hermione was skilled in this subject as she was able to achieve an '[[Exceeds Expectations]]' in her O.W.L.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; In their first year, she mastered the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]].&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; In their third year when she took Professor Lupin's exam, Harry saw that she did everything perfectly except for the part of fighting the [[Boggart]].&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; Despite this aptitude, this was the one subject Harry was better than her at, something she freely acknowledged.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; Hermione mastered all the spells taught by Harry in their fifth year in Dumbledore's Army. She mastered the [[Stunning Spell]], [[Impediment Jinx]], and various other offensive and defensive spells.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; She was capable of using powerful defensive and offensive spells such as the [[Blasting Curse]].&lt;ref name="DH17" /&gt; If Hermione had become an Auror she would have excelled, but she instead dedicated herself to rebuilding the wizard laws. Alongside this, in one alternative universe created by Scorpius and Albus' time-travelling experiences, she became the professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts.

[[File:PetrificusTotalus_PS.gif|250px|thumb|Hermione freezing [[Neville Longbottom]] with the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] in her first year]]
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Hermione was not known for her ability to perform dark magic and the extent of her capacity is truly unknown, but it could be assumed given her borderline genius status that she was no slouch, as she was able to successfully cast various potent [[dark charm]]s. She was able to cast the [[Leg-Locker Curse]] and [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] in her first year,&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; the [[Jelly-Legs Curse|Jelly-Legs Jinx]] in her sixth,&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; and successfully cast a [[Stinging Jinx|Stinging Hex]] at a moment's notice.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Hermione had enough skill to come up with a very sophisticated [[jinx]] [[Dumbledore's Army parchment jinx|that would deform the face of a person who betrayed the D.A]]., which she taught to her comrades.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; She also cast the [[Oppugno Jinx]] to send several conjured canaries at Ron Weasley in [[1996]], to express her annoyance and anger at him for kissing Lavender Brown.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; Furthermore, she was able to cast a particularly powerful and destructive [[Blasting Curse]], which she used to blast Nagini with in Godric's Hollow in [[December]] [[1997]]; a cast so powerful that it broke Harry's [[Harry Potter's wand|wand]].&lt;ref name="DH17" /&gt;

[[File:Hermione_during_Potion_class_pic2.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Hermione attending [[Potions (class)|Potions class]] in her sixth year]]

*'''[[Potion]]s''': Hermione was exceptionally gifted in the field of potion-making. She was able to identify [[potion]]s and their effects quickly after having only read about them.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; She was able to brew the very advanced and difficult Polyjuice Potion in [[1992|second year]] for her, Harry, and Ron to find the truth about the Chamber of Secrets from Draco Malfoy by disguising themselves as his friends.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; She achieved an 'Outstanding' on her Potions [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] and was only one of twelve to advance to N.E.W.T.-level. Hermione was the only one in her sixth year class who understood [[Golpalott's Third Law]], without need for further explanation and was able to compose an antidote containing fifty-two ingredients, including a chunk of her own hair. The only time she was ever out-smarted in potions was in her sixth year by Harry Potter because he was using the [[Severus Snape's copy of Advanced Potion-Making|Half-Blood Prince's old copy]] of the [[Advanced Potion-Making]] textbook that was full of hints and scribbles that helped Harry excel. This frustrated her greatly.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

*'''[[Herbology]]''': Hermione earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in this subject, showing great talent in this field, and even studied it at N.E.W.T. level. She was particularly skilled in spells related to handling magical plants. In her first year, she saved Harry and Ron from some [[Devil's Snare]] in the [[Underground Chambers]] by conjuring [[Bluebell Flames]].&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; She had knowledge of various different plants; for example, in her [[second year]], she was the only one who knew what the [[Mandrake]] root was and of its potent [[Healing magic|healing]] and restorative properties.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; She was also very capable of casting the [[Herbivicus Charm]] by her fourth year, in order to magically growth plants at an excelled rate.&lt;ref name="GOFG"&gt;{{GOF|G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Alchemy]]''': Hermione had read a book containing information on Alchemy and the Philosopher's Stone in her first year, which she understood well.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; In her sixth year, she easily understood [[Golpalott's Third Law]].&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Hermione was the first in her [[Apparition (class)|class]] to [[Apparition|Apparate]] successfully, achieving Apparition twice in that time and passed her test on the first attempt. According to Ron, her performance was "''perfect''" and the [[Wilkie Twycross|instructor]] praised her talent greatly.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; While on the hunt for the Horcruxes with Harry and Ron, Hermione frequently Apparated and Disapparated the three of them using side-along Apparition, twice when they were falling through the air.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|Arithmancy looks terrible.|Hermione Granger|Oh no, it's wonderful! It's my favourite subject!|Hermione's love of Arithmancy|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}

*'''[[Arithmancy]]''': This was Hermione's favourite subject at Hogwarts. Considering she was one of the few people to take this subject, so she must have had considerable skill and knowledge in this field.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; She earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L and took the subject to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level, showing to have been exceptionally gifted in this field, given how Arithmancy is considered to be immensely difficult and complicated.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

[[File:Dittany.gif|250px|thumb|Hermione healing a [[Splinching|Splinched]] Ron with Essence of Dittany in 1997]]

*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Hermione had impressive skills in and knowledge of healing magic. She had knowledge of the [[Mandrake]]'s healing properties in her second year,&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; and was able to skilfully take care of both Harry Potter's wound from fighting Nagini&lt;ref name="DH17"&gt;{{DH|B|17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ron Weasley's splinching wound in 1997,&lt;ref name="DH14" /&gt; using [[Essence of Dittany]]. She was also knowledgeable of [[healing spell]]s, but was not confident enough in using them on a Splinched Ron, as she feared causing him more damage.&lt;ref name="DH14"&gt;{{DH|B|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Study of Ancient Runes]]''': Hermione was gifted in translating ancient runes into English. She earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in the subject and took it to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; This is what later helped lead her, Harry, and Ron to the Deathly Hallows. She later translated the original copy of {{TBB}} into English, which she published sometime before working at the [[British Ministry of Magic]].
*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Hermione was very interested in the history of the [[wizarding world]] from a young age. Even before starting at Hogwarts, she bought several books and learned them by heart. She was one of very few students who payed attention to Professor Binns' lectures, being known to take excellent notes in the class. She earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in the subject, which was hard to do,&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; considering how boring the class was said to be.
*'''[[Astronomy]]''': Hermione was known to have gained an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in this subject, but she decided not to continue with it at N.E.W.T.-level.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; She often helped Harry and Ron do their homework as they often didn't remember the required facts.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;
{{Dialogue a-b|Ron Weasley|What are you doing Muggle Studies for? You're Muggle-born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all about Muggles!|Hermione Granger|But it'll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view.|Hermione's interest in Muggle studies|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}

*'''[[Muggle Studies]]''': This was one of the subjects Hermione chose to take in her third year with the aid of a [[Time-Turner]]. She was exceptionally good at it because she could bring another point of view to the classroom and the lessons, achieving a score of over 300% on her final exam in third year. However, Hermione dropped the subject after a year, as she was a Muggle-born witch and so knew a great deal about Muggles already.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt;
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Hermione earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in Care of Magical Creatures.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; She had no problem interacting with the [[Hippogriff]] [[Buckbeak]] in her third year,&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; but stated in her sixth that he scared her.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; Her skills at interacting were demonstrated with her views on house-elves and her work on S.P.E.W.,&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; having a good relationship with house-elves like Dobby and Winky and encouraging Harry to treat [[Kreacher]] more kindly after he inherited him.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; These skills allowed her to join the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] where she continued her work with S.P.E.W., working for the rights of both house-elves and other underprivileged non-humans.
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Although Hermione was not particularly confident with flying a [[broomstick]], she was at least a reasonable flyer herself, as she was able to successfully fly on a broomstick in the [[Underground Chambers]] in order to catch a [[Winged Keys|Winged Key]], which she did without any difficulties, being able to soar through the air proficiently.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt;
*'''[[Spell creation]]''' (possibly): Hermione was highly implied to have successfully created at least one spell, a [[Dumbledore's Army parchment jinx|jinx]] that she placed upon the list of Dumbledore's Army members which, if activated, would cause the affected person's face to break out in boils that formed the word "SNEAK" and which could not be reversed by any known counter-spell. She may also have invented the Four-Point Spell, a useful spell that would make the user's wand point north to indicate direction. If so, this further shows her remarkable and outstanding skill and magical talent, as spell creation is noted to be extremely dangerous and only to be attempted by the most skilled wizards.

*'''Intellectual giftedness''': Hermione was noted to be a "''borderline genius''",&lt;ref name="WBUR"&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc.html 12 October 1999 WBUR Radio interview with J.K. Rowling]&lt;/ref&gt; getting top scores in every class, and getting 'Outstanding' in all her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]] except [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. She mentioned in her fifth year that the [[Sorting Hat]] considered placing her in [[Ravenclaw]], but in the end decided on Sorting her into [[Gryffindor]].&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; Hermione had a mastery of logic that most wizards lacked, as she stated that "''a lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic''". In 1992, she was able to use logic to get Harry past a protective measure that was taken to protect the [[Philosopher's Stone]] by Severus Snape. Hermione often provided the trio with vital information when carrying out research into the various mysteries they faced. For example, she was the one to figure out through research that the monster in the Chamber of Secrets was a Basilisk and in her third year that Professor Lupin was a werewolf. However, she tended to rely more heavily on facts and information that could be proven by background analysis rather than making intuitive leaps, so Harry was generally the one to put the pieces together which explain recent events to create the final picture and willing to make assumptions where Hermione disproved ideas if there was no clear evidence for them.
*'''Leadership skills''': While Harry did the majority of leading among the trio, it was usually Hermione who kept him on track when he, Ron and herself had a task to do, and she sometimes did the same only with Ron. She also helped form and co-lead Dumbledore's Army alongside Harry. Her leadership skills were again demonstrated when she joined the Ministry, helping improve the rights of House Elves and other underprivileged magical creatures in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and then getting promoted to Deputy Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, in which she helped eradicate the old laws which only favoured pure bloods. Despite not desiring high positions and only leading when she was forced to do so and when the time was right, she was eventually promoted to the post of Minister for Magic before 2019.

==Possessions==
[[File:HermioneGrangerWandNN8411.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Hermione's first wand]]
*'''[[Hermione Granger's wand|Vinewood wand]]''': Hermione purchased a 10¾" [[vine]] wood [[Hermione Granger's wand|wand]] with a [[dragon heartstring]] core in [[1991]]. There was a pattern of vines the whole way up the wand's handle. She used it until the spring of [[1998]], when she, [[Harry Potter]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] were captured by [[Snatchers]], who confiscated their wands. She subsequently used [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s [[Bellatrix Lestrange's first wand|wand]].&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;
*'''[[Bellatrix Lestrange's first wand|Bellatrix Lestrange's wand]]''': In [[1998]], after the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]], Hermione lost her own wand while Ron [[Disarming Charm|Disarmed]] [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Harry grabbed Bellatrix's [[Bellatrix Lestrange's first wand|wand]] as they left and Hermione subsequently used it, though it didn't work well for her, as she did not win its allegiance. Hermione used this wand at least until the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], when she fought Bellatrix with her own wand.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;[[File:Bellatrix Lestrange first wand.png|150px|thumb|right|Bellatrix Lestrange's first wand]]
*'''[[Time-Turner]]''': In [[1993]], just before her [[third year]] at Hogwarts, Hermione obtained a [[Time-Turner]] from the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in order to facilitate her attending more classes. She also used it at the end of the school year to save [[Sirius Black]] and [[Buckbeak]], along with [[Harry Potter]]. Afterwards, Hermione returned the Time-Turner, returning to a normal class schedule.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt;
*'''[[Hermione Granger's beaded handbag|Charmed handbag]]''': Hermione had a small, beaded [[Hermione Granger's beaded handbag|handbag]] on which she placed an [[Extension Charm|Undetectable Extension Charm]] in the summer of [[1997]]. She used the handbag to carry supplies such as clothing, books, [[Dittany]], and camping equipment on her, Harry, and Ron's quest to locate and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. The bag was small enough to fit in her sock, so as to not have it stolen during the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]].&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;
*'''[[Dumbledore's Army coin]]:''': The Dumbledore's Army coin was a fake [[Galleon]] created by Hermione in [[1995]] to inform members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] when the next meeting would take place.

Additionally, during the Horcrux Hunt, Hermione kept a copy of ''Secrets of the Darkest Art'', in which she learned of the dark magic that can be used to split one's soul and how the effects of having a split soul can affect the human being as a result of using such incredible and highly dark magic.

*'''[[Hermione Granger's pencil case|Pencil case]]''': She had a large pencil case which allowed her to keep all her quill and other writing equipment together. She is first noted to have had it in her [[sixth year]] when an argument with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] made her wipe her wet eyes on it.&lt;ref name="HBP15"&gt;{{HBP|B|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, highly possible that she owned this object since her [[first year]] and had not replaced it since.

[[File:Hermione's mother 1.jpeg|left|thumb|206x206px|[[Hermione Granger's mother|Mrs Granger]], her mother]]
Mr and Mrs Granger were [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[dentist]]s who seemed proud of their [[Wizardkind|witch]] daughter. They appeared to be accepting of the [[wizarding world]], as they went shopping with Hermione in [[Diagon Alley]] and allowed her to spend several holidays with the [[Weasley family]],&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; but did not approve of their daughter using magic as a quick-fix, as indicated by their not allowing Hermione to magically fix her teeth.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; They correspond by owl post with their daughter throughout the school year,&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; but other than one holiday in [[France]] with her parents, Hermione spent almost all of her time in the wizarding world. In [[1995]], she planned to go [[skiing]] with them during the [[Christmas holidays]], but ended up going to [[12 Grimmauld Place]] to try to cheer Harry up instead. Hermione told her parents that the reason for her cancelling was to study for exams, indicating that her parents expected her to do well in school and were probably not aware of the extent of their daughter's involvement in activities relating to the [[Second Wizarding War]].&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;

To protect them during the height of the war, Hermione [[False memory spell|modified her parents' memories]] in [[1997]] to make them believe they were entirely different people, and they left the country.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; After the war, she found them in [[Australia]] and restored their memories.

====Children====

[[File:Hermione_and_Rose.jpg|251x251px|thumb|Hermione hugging Rose before Rose departs for [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|school]]|left]]

After the [[Second Wizarding War]], Hermione had two children with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]: a daughter named [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and a son named [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]].

Rose started her first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[2017]], along with her cousin, [[Albus Potter|Albus]]. Ron stated that Rose had inherited her mother's brains. Hermione was probably very close to Rose because she was also described as smart, yet not a complete know-it-all.

Hugo was born in [[2006]] or [[2007]]. He most likely inherited his father's [[Quidditch]] skills, as he was noted to fly a lot with his cousins [[Albus Potter]] and [[James Potter II|James Potter]]. He also appeared to have a quiet demeanour.

====Nieces and nephews====
[[File:Harry's kids.png|230x230px|thumb|The Potter children, some of Hermione's nieces and nephews]]

As four of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s five surviving siblings were married by 2017, Hermione had quite a few nieces and nephews through her husband: [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] had three children ([[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]]), as did [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] ([[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]] and [[Louis Weasley|Louis]]), while [[George Weasley|George]] and [[Angelina Johnson]] had a son and a daughter ([[Fred Weasley II|Fred]] and [[Roxanne Weasley|Roxanne]]), and [[Percy Weasley]] had two daughters ([[Molly Weasley II|Molly]] and [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]]) with his wife, [[Audrey Weasley|Audrey]]. [[Victoire Weasley]], one of Fleur and Bill's daughters, was seen kissing [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]] at [[King's Cross Station]], by [[James Potter II|James Potter]], Hermione's nephew and godson. Hermione visited them all on many occasions. It can be assumed that she was closest with Harry's children.

====Other Weasley family members====
[[File:Weasley Wizarding Vacation in Egypt.png|235x235px|thumb|left|The [[Weasley family]], her future in-laws]]

Because of her friendships with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], Hermione became friendly with the entire [[Weasley family]]. She spent a portion of many of her summer holidays at their home of [[the Burrow]], and attended some family outings with them, such as shopping for school supplies in [[Diagon Alley]] and attending the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]] with them. [[Arthur Weasley]] was fascinated by the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] world and thus Hermione's background, and even invited Hermione's [[Granger family|parents]] for a drink upon first meeting them. [[Molly Weasley]] was fond of Hermione, though she treated her coldly for a brief time after [[Rita Skeeter]] printed lies about Hermione toying with the hearts of [[Harry Potter]] and [[Viktor Krum]], much to Hermione's bewilderment. After Harry explained that the stories were false, Mrs Weasley once again warmed up to Hermione. Also, she and [[Percy Weasley]] were considered to be on good terms until their fight over elf rights.

[[File:GF Weasley TDH promo.jpg|thumb|235x235px|[[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], her friends and future brothers-in-law]]
Fred and George Weasley seemed to regard Hermione and Harry almost like other younger siblings, teasing them as well as being protective of them. When [[Draco Malfoy]] called Hermione a "[[Mudblood]]" in [[1992]], the twins were outraged, and attempted to attack him.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; Although Hermione disapproved of some of their antics, trying to use her status as a [[prefect]] to keep them in line, she still got on well with them. Hermione once argued with them that the [[Ageing Potion]] they planned on using to trick the age line protecting the [[Goblet of Fire]] wouldn't work because Dumbledore would have already thought of a foolish ageing potion. They didn't listen and tried to cross the line which resulted in them being thrown back and grow long, white beards.The only time she was notably angry with them was when they tested out their [[Skiving Snackbox]]es on unsuspecting [[first year]] students; though the twins initially scoffed at her concerns and her ability to make them stop, they backed down when she threatened to tell their [[Molly Weasley|mother]].

However, Hermione still admired the cleverness and creativity of their spell work,&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; once remarking that they could do some "''extraordinary magic''," which Fred was flattered enough by to offer Hermione material from their [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|joke shop]] free of charge.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; Fred and George also tried to get Hermione to relax, joking around with her about things such as their late uncle [[Bilius]]'s penchant for making mischief at weddings.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Hermione was devastated when Fred was killed during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Hermione was not as close to the other Weasley siblings, though she was invited to [[William Weasley|Bill]]'s [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] to [[Fleur Delacour]] in [[1997]].

With her marriage to Ron, Hermione became a part of the Weasley family herself.

====Fleur Delacour====
{{Quote|She really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn't she?|Hermione's scornful attitude towards Fleur|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Fleur Delacour.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|[[Fleur Delacour]], her future sister-in-law]]

When Hermione first met Fleur Delacour, an incredibly beautiful, [[France|French]], part-[[Veela]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], in [[1994]], during the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Hermione disliked Fleur almost immediately, as she was given to fussily and loudly criticising nearly everything at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], from the weather, to the decoration and food. The fact that Ron had a little bit of a crush on Fleur didn't help, but he eventually got over it.

Hermione, like Ginny and [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]], was infuriated by Fleur's arrogance and constant complaining when [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] sent Fleur, his then fiancée, to [[the Burrow]] to get to know his family. However, when Fleur responded to Bill becoming permanently disfigured by [[Fenrir Greyback]] with indignant denial that Bill's appearance would in any way effect their marital plans, Hermione most likely set her feelings aside.

Despite seeming rather inconsiderate and self-centred, Fleur proved to be courageous and ultimately caring, even selfless, in her own way. She put her life in danger by posing as one of Harry's decoys in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], and after the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|Battle of Malfoy Manor]], Hermione, Harry and Ron, along with [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Dean Thomas]], and an injured [[Garrick Ollivander]] and [[Griphook]], stayed with Bill and Fleur for a month at [[Shell Cottage]], where Fleur took care of them all like a mother. Later, Fleur became Hermione's sister-in-law through her marriage to [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], and Hermione's marriage to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].

===Romances===
====Ron Weasley====
{{Quote|Oh, maybe she and Ron will be alright with a bit of counselling, you know. I wonder what happens at wizard marriage counselling? They'll probably be fine. He needs to work on his self-esteem issues and she needs to work on being a little less critical.|[[J. K. Rowling]] on Hermione and Ron's adult relationship|MuggleNet}}[[File:Ron Weasley.jpg|220x220px|thumb|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], the love of her life and father to her children]]

Ronald Weasley was, essentially, the love of Hermione's life. Although their relationship would have many ups and downs, Hermione and Ron Weasley were good friends for most of their years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and of course, were best friends with [[Harry Potter]], who was usually a mediator in their disputes. They tended to argue frequently, though they usually got over their arguments, which tended to be minor or about trivial issues, although there were a few times when it seemed as if their friendship would be irreparable. As they grew older and matured, Ron and Hermione tended to fight less often and become more in touch with their feelings for each other. Hermione sometimes had the tendency of calling [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] "''Ronald''". Their first major falling-out was in their third year, when Ron accused Hermione's pet cat [[Crookshanks]] of eating his pet rat [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]].&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt;

Hints of her feelings for Ron were shown as early as their first year, when she was badly hurt emotionally when he made fun of her for not having friends due to her bookish and bossy nature. According to Neville she spent the whole afternoon crying in the loo before the incident with the troll took place. In their third year Ron saw Sirius Black standing over him with a knife, Hermione was shocked and scared the most and even cried. They were both very awkward and embarrassed at times, being insecure with their own feelings for each other. Ron was used to always being in Harry's shadow and did not want the girl he loved to be also taken from him by his best friend. Hermione was greatly offended when Ron initially didn't ask her to the Yule Ball as his partner until he got rejected by Fleur Delacour. When it is revealed Viktor Krum was Hermione's date, a jealous Ron got into a heated row with Hermione, which she ended by making clear that she would go as Ron's date in future if only he asked her as his first choice. Ron and Hermione's relationship again suffered when Ron began dating [[Lavender Brown]] in [[1996]], though the two reconciled after Ron was accidentally poisoned, leaving Hermione shaken. Ron's relationship with Lavender ended soon after, and both he and Hermione were more content for it.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt;

[[File:Ron-y-Hermione-en-la-Madriguera.jpg|226x226px|thumb|left|Hermione and Ron expressing their affection for each other]]

{{Quote|Ron, you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet|Hermione tells Ron off for his insensitivity with girls' feelings|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

Hints of romantic feelings between the two could be seen as early as their [[1992|second year]], as Ron was particularly protective of Hermione and disgusted by her crush on [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]. Also During the second year when Malfoy insulted Hermione calling her a mudblood an enranged Ron attempted to punish him with a curse, but as his wand was broken, the curse backfired on him injuring him.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; During the [[Yule Ball]] in [[1994]], Hermione was affronted by Ron's clumsy attempt to ask her to go with him, and Ron was jealous of her attendance with [[Viktor Krum]]; this jealousy would persist for years. In turn, Hermione was jealous of Ron's crush on [[Fleur Delacour]], though expressed it in a subtler way.

In her fourth year while Harry and Ron were not in speaking terms following Harry's name coming out of the goblet of fire, Hermione defended Ron to Harry reminding him that despite him not wanting it he always gets all the attention while Ron had to live up competing with his five older brothers and Ron is always made to feel second to him.

In their fifth year, Hermione kissed Ron on the cheek before the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Tournament]], to which he reacted by being "puzzled" and touching the spot where she kissed him. During Gryffindor's Quidditch try-outs in their sixth year, Hermione also [[Confundus Charm|Confunded]] Cormac McLaggen to increase Ron's chances of being made the team's Keeper. Also, Hermione became jealous (but she tried to conceal it) when Ron began dating [[Lavender Brown]] and kissing her frequently.

[[File:DH1 Ron and Hermione picking up stones.jpg|235px|thumb|right|Ron and Hermione spending time together during the Hocrux hunt]]

{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione|I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back!|Ron Weasley |I know. Hermione, I'm sorry, I'm really—|Oh, you're ''sorry''! You came back after weeks — ''weeks'' — and you think it's all going to be all right if you just say sorry?... Weeks and weeks, we could have been ''dead''…|Hermione and Ron after the latter's return to her and Harry|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

By the summer of [[1997]], the two were closer than ever and "sort of" together, according to Harry. They danced together at [[William Weasley|Bill]] and Fleur's [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]], and were generally kinder to one another. During the hunt for the [[Horcrux]]es, Ron comforted Hermione several times by putting his arm around her, and Harry believed that they might have fallen asleep holding hands. When Harry was briefly shouting at Hermione who was confronting him aboust his fallout with Remus Lupin and Harry was shouting at her, Ron defended Hermione from Harry by angrily saying "'Don't you start on her!' Hermione was extremely upset when Ron temporarily left her and Harry, crying often, and she was absolutely furious with him when he returned. It was also revealed, through a vision caused by the [[Slytherin's Locket|locket Horcrux]], that one of Ron's deepest fears was that Hermione preferred Harry to him.

[[File:Hermione and Ron kissing in the Chamber of Secrets.gif|240x240px|thumb|left|Ron and Hermione's first kiss during the Battle of Hogwarts]]

The two eventually made up, and Hermione initiated a kiss during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], when Ron suggested saving the [[house-elf|house-elves]] and not ordering them to fight for wizards. Hermione, who had been a promoter of house-elf rights since her fourth year and even started her own society to help house-elves (the [[Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare]]) was so delighted at Ron's unexpected display of sensitivity that she kissed him on the lips, something that was met with surprise, eagerness and enthusiasm, but caused the pair to become embarrassed after Harry asked them to "''hold it in''".

Some people had expected Ron and Hermione to become more than friends much sooner and Harry Potter had even thought that they would start dating in their sixth year. In the fifth year while Hermione and Harry were arguing about Harry's decision to talk to Sirius, Hermione asked Ron's advice in a manner that "reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place."  In 1997, when the Trio was captured by [[Snatchers]] and brought to [[Malfoy Manor]], [[Fenrir Greyback]] mistakenly called Ron Hermione's boyfriend when she tried to protect him. Also, Ron screamed and yelled and was in terrible distress when he heard Hermione being tortured by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] in Malfoy Manor. The pair eventually married and had two children, [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo Weasley]].&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

They were rather young when they were married, and their relationship evolved over time. By the time that Hermione was elected Minister For Magic, Ron had become more the stay-at-home-dad due to the convenience it placed on their respective careers, as Ron's entrepreneurial exploits could be more easily conducted than Hermione's careers in law enforcement and eventually politics. Their combative relationship eventually subsided for a more affectionate one, as Ron was seen to kiss Hermione in public extremely often as noted by their nephew, Albus Potter. Hermione was initially wary when Ron spoke of how early they had married and was jokingly suspicious that he wanted a break from their marriage, but was deeply moved when Ron told her that he wanted to renew their vows and marry her all over again after reading about how Muggles occasionally did such a thing. Hermione was so touched by her husband's suggestion that they began to kiss passionately over her mountain of paperwork in her office. This shows how Ron had matured into a startling romantic over the years and how it helped to temper their initially rocky relationship that begun 31 years prior.

====Viktor Krum====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione|How did [[Rita Skeeter|she]] know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?...

[[File:Goffilm39.1.jpg|232x232px|thumb|left|[[Viktor Krum]], her friend and Yule Ball date]]

Viktor Krum, a renowned professional [[Quidditch]] player and student of [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], came to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1994]] for the [[Triwizard Tournament]], in which he was a Champion. He took to following Hermione into the library, watching her and trying to "''pluck up the courage''" to speak to her. Eventually, he asked her to be his date to the [[Yule Ball]], and Hermione accepted. Their arrival together caused something of a stir, given Viktor's fame and Hermione's exceptional, and rather unexpected, beauty.

Hermione was Viktor's 'hostage' during the Second Task of the Tournament. After he pulled her from the lake, Viktor told Hermione that he had never felt about someone the way he felt about her, and invited her to visit him in [[Bulgaria]] over the summer.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; At some point, it is alleged by Ginny Weasley during a confrontation with her brother Ron, that he and Hermione shared a kiss during that period.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; Whether or not Ginny was just trying to get under Ron's skin or if this actually happened is unknown. What is known is that their relationship never became serious enough for her to visit him in Bulgaria, they kept in contact through letters over the years.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; They met again at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] in [[1997]], where Viktor complimented Hermione and was disappointed to learn that she had "sort of" begun a romance with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

===Friends===
====Harry Potter====
{{Quote|[Harry] put his arm around Hermione's shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore's mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.|Harry and Hermione share a moment at his parents' grave|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Harry Potter.jpg|thumb|224x224px|[[Harry Potter]], her best friend and future co-brother-in-law]]
Hermione became friends with Harry Potter after they as well as [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] took down a [[Mountain Troll]] together in their first year.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; They tended to get along very well on a day-to-day basis, though Harry occasionally became annoyed by Hermione's nagging, while she occasionally became annoyed by his lack of discipline and conviction in his schoolwork. Their only notable row was over Hermione getting Harry's [[Firebolt]] confiscated in their third year, which she felt it might be a trap. Harry and Ron reconciled with Hermione after [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] scolded them for their treatment of her. Harry and Hermione were quite similar in their dour, brooding tendencies in times of trouble, and often needed Ron's humour and levity to counterbalance their intense personalities.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron spent nearly all their time together during their years at Hogwarts, and shortly afterwards, Hermione led Harry through [[Time-Turner|time-travel]], and together they rescued [[Sirius Black]] and [[Buckbeak]]; Hermione breaking the rules of using her Time-Turner, something she admitted was incredibly dangerous, demonstrated the strength of her friendship with Harry.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; The [[1994|following year]], Hermione was the only student who believed Harry when he told her he had not put his name in the [[Goblet of Fire]], and spent much of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] teaching Harry useful spells and trying to reconcile him and Ron.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione Granger|Harry — you're a great wizard, you know.|Harry Potter|I'm not as good as you.|Me! Books! And cleverness! There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful!|Hermione's bond with Harry|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
While Harry and Hermione typically argued less than Ron and Hermione, they had the most philosophical and moral disagreements with one another. Ron typically deferred to Harry's opinions on important decisions, and tends to hold back when Hermione confronts Harry about them, letting them battle it out. For example, Harry and Hermione fought about how best to deal with [[Dolores Umbridge]] when she infiltrated Hogwarts, whether or not Sirius's judgement could be trusted, whether or not Harry should have tried to use [[Occlumency]] to block out his mental link with Voldemort, whether Dumbledore's past made him an unworthy leader, and whether they should have pursued the Hallows or the Horcruxes. Hermione expressed immense displeasure to Harry during the sixth year after he started obtaining better results than her at Potion by the help of the "Half Blood Prince's potions book". Harry tended to be dismissive of Hermione's opinions, and could even grow angry when she tried to argue her point, but many times realised later that she was right. For example, Harry was often dismissive of Hermione's insistence that all [[House-elf|house-elves]] deserve respect and kindness, and was neglectful towards [[Kreacher]] because of his bigotry until he finally realised the horrifying nature of his enslavement.

[[File:Harry&amp;Hermion poa.gif|240x240px|thumb|Hermione protecting Harry, demonstrating her willingness to put his best interests first|left]]

While Harry tended to have more fun with Ron, Hermione was consistently his place of refuge when others abandoned him, from Ron's jealous withdrawal during the Triwizard Tournament, to Harry's discovery of Dumbledore's past during the war. Despite their differences, Harry and Hermione tended to support one another at the expense of others when necessary. Hermione repeatedly chose to help and support Harry in his fight against Voldemort, regardless of personal cost. Examples include breaking the laws regarding time travel in order to help him save Sirius, teaching him defensive magic in preparation for the [[Triwizard Tournament]], blackmailing [[Rita Skeeter]] in order to give him a way to tell the public about Voldemort's return, protecting him from torture by Dolores Umbridge, and Obliviating her parents in order to go on the run with him. She notably chose to support him even when Ron did not. Smaller acts of friendship included helping him with homework and cheering him on at Quidditch games.

Harry was similarly protective and supportive of Hermione. Much like Hermione, Harry was often a place of refuge for Hermione when others leave her. Harry often comforted Hermione and showed her kindness and care when she was upset. On the occasion that Buckbeak the Hippogriff was executed, Harry consoled her as she cries.

He was also quick to defend Hermione from Cho Chang, Draco Malfoy, and others who insulted her for her looks or parentage, which showed his pride in her intellect on numerous occasions. He consistently praised her intelligence and magical skills to teachers, asked her for help in dangerous situations, and defended her against bullies. On one occasion, he even choose to side with her over Ron when was dating Lavender. But he expressed outrage when Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen.

Harry also defended Hermione physically on instinct. This showed his willingness to put her before himself as well as his unconditional brotherly love for her. For example, when Lupin turned into a werewolf and attacked Hermione and Harry in [[1994]], Harry shielded her from the danger.

Many people, including [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Cho Chang]], [[Viktor Krum]], [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]], have occasionally mistaken Harry and Hermione's relationship to be a romantic one, given their closeness and expressions of physical affection, such as kisses on the cheek, staying by one another's bedsides when hurt or injured, embracing each other, and holding hands.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The film adaptation of ''Goblet of Fire'' expands on this by having Hermione and Harry being caught in a friendly embrace by [[Rita Skeeter]] who incorrectly interprets it as teen romance. In the film adaptation of ''Half-Blood Prince'' Harry asks Hermione to go to Slughorn's party as his date, but she declines, having already decided to take McLaggen to annoy Ron.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry eventually explained to Ron that he and Hermione were like brother and sister.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; They shared similar upbringings as being only children raised in the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] world, and showed each other unconditional love despite their many differences and disagreements. During their time alone during the war, Ron and Harry maintained a distance, with Hermione mostly crying for Ron and Harry observing Ginny's dot at the Marauder's map. They did exchange a comforting moment during their brief embrace after Harry visited his parent's grave.&lt;ref name="HAH"&gt;[[J. K. Rowling]]'s comments in ''[[Harry, A History: The True Story of a Boy Wizard, His Fans, and Life Inside the Harry Potter Phenomenon|Harry, A History]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermione and Harry remained best friends into adulthood, and eventually became co-siblings in-law when Hermione married [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and Harry married [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]. Hermione was also the aunt and godmother of Harry's three children: [[James Potter II|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna]]. They were also coworkers for many years as employees of the Ministry of Magic in law enforcement.

It is interesting to note that Albus Dumbledore's final plan to defeat Lord Voldemort, in which Harry would learn the story of the Deathly Hallows in time to use them against Voldemort, revolved not only around Harry himself, but Hermione as well. Dumbledore knew that Harry was too passionate and angry to be able to keep from attempting to become Master of Death, and so entrusted {{TBB}} to Hermione, so that she would learn of the Hallows' symbol first and would be able to caution and guide Harry down the path of reason.

====Ginny Weasley====
{{Dialogue a-b|Ginny Weasley |Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more — myself.|Harry Potter|Smart girl, that Hermione.|Ginny regarding how she confides in Hermione|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Ginny Weasley.jpg|211x211px|thumb|[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], her good friend and future sister-in-law]]

Ginny Weasley was Hermione's best female friend and Ginny's confidante. The two grew close when Hermione stayed in Ginny's room at [[the Burrow]] during her many summertime visits. Ginny was the only one Hermione told about being asked to the [[Yule Ball]] by [[Viktor Krum]],&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt; while Hermione was the only one who knew that Ginny had been learning to fly in secret for years.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; She also gave Ginny advice about dealing with her feelings for Harry — advice that eventually led to the two dating,&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; and eventually marrying.

Hermione comforted Ginny after an encounter with [[Dementor]]s upset her in [[1993]],&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; and after the death of her brother [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] in [[1998]].&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; However, Hermione would not have been afraid to stand up to Ginny when she felt that Ginny was wrong. The two remained very close after [[Second Wizarding War|the war]] and eventually became sisters-in-law when Hermione married Ron, making her an aunt to Ginny's three children, [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily]], as well as being chosen to be godmother to Ginny's eldest son James, and making Ginny Rose and Hugo's aunt and almost certainly Rose's godmother.

====Neville Longbottom====
{{Dialogue a-b|Phineas Nigellus|Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!|Hermione|Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!|The portrait of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] discussing the attempted theft of [[Sword of Gryffindor|Gryffindor's Sword]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Neville Longbottom.jpg|240x240px|thumb|[[Neville Longbottom]], her friend|left]]

Hermione was good friends with Neville Longbottom. They met on the [[Hogwarts Express|train]] to Hogwarts during their first year and she helped him search for his toad [[Trevor]].&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; Hermione helped Neville many times with their school work, particularly with [[Potions (class)|Potions]], as [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] noted that she was often "''hissing instructions in his ear''."&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; In their [[1994|fourth year]], Hermione noticed Neville's horrified reaction to witnessing the [[Cruciatus Curse]] be performed on a [[spider]] by Professor [[Alastor Moody]] (actually [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]]), and shrieked for the teacher to stop. That same year, Neville asked Hermione to attend the [[Yule Ball]] with him, as she had "''always been really nice''" to him, though she had already agreed to accompany [[Viktor Krum]].&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

Hermione often fiercely defended Neville when others insulted him, and her friendship and support, as well as that of other [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members, likely contributed to Neville gradually gaining self-confidence and courage.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Neville was obviously very fond of Hermione, and appreciative of her kindness and all the help she had given him. It was hinted that he spoke of her frequently to his grandmother, [[Augusta Longbottom]], who seemed to already know a good deal about Hermione when they first met at Saint Mungo's in [[1995]]. Following the war, they kept in touch.

====Luna Lovegood====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione|What about Luna?|Ron Weasley |Well, if they're telling the truth and she's still alive —|Don't say that, don't say it! She must be alive, she must!|Hermione, Ron, and Harry after their escape from the [[Lovegood House]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Luna Lovegood.jpg|thumb|245x245px|[[Luna Lovegood]], a good friend]]
Although Hermione rarely saw eye-to-eye with Luna Lovegood due to their very different world views and beliefs, the two became very good friends through [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Hermione first met Luna on the [[Hogwarts Express]] in [[1995]]; she insulted ''[[The Quibbler]]'', but backtracked when Luna told her that her [[Xenophilius Lovegood|father]] was the editor. Hermione was frustrated with Luna's belief in all manner of things without proof or logical grounds, but eventually simply accepted their differences, telling Luna that her planned trip to Sweden in search of a [[Crumple-Horned Snorkack]] sounded "''lovely''".&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;

The following year, Luna comforted Hermione when she was upset over her fight with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]].&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; Hermione was one of the five portraits Luna painted — along with Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Neville — and hung from her bedroom ceiling, the word "''friends''" linking them in gold writing. When [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] attempted to turn Harry, Ron, and Hermione over to [[Death Eaters]] in exchange for his daughter's safety, Hermione [[Ambush at the Lovegood House|engineered their escape]] so that the Death Eaters saw Harry briefly, thus ensuring that both Luna and her father were not harmed. Despite disagreeing with Luna on many things herself, Hermione defended her when others insulted her; for example, she tried to kick Ron for teasing Luna about [[Gurdyroot]]s at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]], and snapped at the portrait of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] for calling Luna an oddity. The two girls remained close friends in adulthood and saw each other regularly. Luna may be one of the best female friends of Hermione (along with Ginny), as she was only seen with these girls during her school-time at Hogwarts.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;

====Sirius Black====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Hermione|But Harry, you've just said it. [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if you'd done [[Occlumency]] properly you'd never seen this —|Harry Potter|IF YOU THINK I'M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVEN'T SEEN —|Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind|WELL, I EXPECT HE'D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF HE KNEW WHAT I'D JUST —|[[Harry Potter]] and Hermione on Sirius Black being supposedly tortured|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[File:OOTP promo front closeup Sirius Black.jpg|247x247px|thumb|left|[[Sirius Black]], her friend]]

Hermione first learned about Sirius Black in [[1993]], when he escaped [[Azkaban]]. The wizarding world at large knew of him as the wizard who murdered twelve Muggles and a wizard ([[Peter Pettigrew]]) with a single curse. Very few knew of his affiliation with the Potters and those who did also believed that Sirius had betrayed [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]] to Voldemort by revealing their location at [[Godric's Hollow]]. During the events at Hogwarts in [[1993]], Hermione along with Harry, Ron and Lupin discovered that, contrary to their previous beliefs, Sirius Black had never committed the murders for which he had been incarcerated, nor had he betrayed his closest friends. 

The trio managed to save Sirius and Lupin from being subjected to the [[Dementor's Kiss]] at the hands of [[Severus Snape]] by firing three simultaneous [[Disarming Charm]]s at him. Snape was blasted off his feet and knocked unconscious, allowing Harry, Ron and Hermione to continue their interrogation of Sirius who later revealed that Pettigrew had disguised himself in his rat [[Animagus]] form for twelve years in order to escape justice and the wrath of Voldemort's remaining Death Eaters. However, upon exiting the [[Whomping Willow]]'s secret passageway together, Pettigrew shrewdly used Lupin's werewolf transformation as a distraction and escaped. Sirius was soon apprehended and locked in [[Filius Flitwick]]'s office to await the Dementor's Kiss. Harry and Hermione would later use the latter's [[Time-Turner]] to [[Rescue of Sirius Black and Buckbeak|rescue]] Sirius, who became deeply grateful to both of them.

In [[1994]], Hermione, Harry, and Ron visited Sirius at the cave off [[Hogsmeade]] village he was hiding in, bringing him food. Here they discussed the many mysteries that had occurred during that year, the trio learning valuable pieces of information regarding the imprisonment of [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] After the events of the Third Task, Sirius (while in his Animagus form) joined Hermione, Ron and [[Molly Weasley]] at Harry's bedside, each indicating their affections for the latter.

Hermione and Sirius would not meet again until the summer of [[1995]], at the Headquarters of the second [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Sirius was obliged to remain in [[12 Grimmauld Place]] for his own safety (his innocence not yet recognised by the Ministry). Sirius was rather disappointed when Harry was allowed to return to Hogwarts, Hermione pointing out that he had probably been secretly wishing that Harry had been expelled from school so that they could both stay at Grimmauld Place and be "''outcasts together''". Hermione expressed an even deeper understanding of Sirius's emotions when she stated her opinion to Harry that Sirius was attempting to relive his happier school days through his godson. Harry ignored this and became slightly agitated at the suggestion that Sirius might be guilty of such a crude, selfish mentality. However, she severely disapproved of his indifferent and occasionally cruel treatment of his [[house-elf]], [[Kreacher]], despite the fact that Kreacher initially appeared to be disgusted by her and addressed her as "the [[Mudblood]]" (which Hermione often attributed to Kreacher being senile due to his old age.) 

She also thought that Sirius was attempting to live vicariously through her, Harry and Ron when he encouraged them to form Dumbledore's Army, but the two boys became angry and snapped at her when she expressed this belief. Sirius was eventually killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], much to the dismay of his friends and loved ones. Hermione was devastated by his death, and often tried to provide comfort to Harry, who had been even more deeply affected by the tragedy. At the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Hermione became godmother to Harry's eldest son, [[James Potter II|James Sirius]], whose first and middle name was derived from James Potter and Sirius Black respectively.

====Crookshanks====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Ron Weasley |Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!|Hermione|He didn't mean to, did you, Crookshanks?... Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he'd been in there for ages; no one wanted him.|I wonder why.|Hermione and Ron when she bought Crookshanks|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}[[File:Hermione poa.jpg|thumb|right|Hermione with Crookshanks]]

[[Crookshanks]] was Hermione's large, bandy-legged, half-[[Kneazle]], ginger-coloured pet cat since she bought him from the [[Magical Menagerie]] in [[Diagon Alley]], in [[1993]]. She seemed to think he was gorgeous, although no one else had wanted to buy him when he was still being sold at the Menagerie. She was proud of his cleverness. The latter proved to be quite true during the [[1993–1994 school year]].&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt;

Crookshanks recognised that Hermione had left him at [[the Burrow]] before Bill and Fleur's [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] in [[1997]],&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; most likely had been left in care of Mrs Weasley or Ginny, but it is possible that they were reunited after the Second War given the deep care and affection they had for each other.

===Hogwarts Students===
====Roommates====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Ron Weasley |I love you, Hermione.|Hermione|Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.|I won't. Or maybe I will... then she'll ditch me...|Hermione and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] talking|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Jessie-Cave-M1.jpg|220x220px|thumb|[[Lavender Brown]], her roommate and romantic rival|left]]

Hermione's roommates at Hogwarts were fellow [[Gryffindor]]s Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil as well as [[Fay Dunbar]] and [[Unidentified red-haired Gryffindor girl|another girl]]. While Lavender and Parvati swiftly became best friends, Hermione was not very close to either of them. Although the girls did not dislike each other, they had very different interests and sometimes clashed as a result. 

For example, Hermione scorned [[Divination]], Lavender and Parvati's favourite subject, and accidentally upset Lavender with her clumsy attempt to comfort her over the death of her rabbit.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; Hermione was also angry with Lavender for doubting [[Harry Potter]]'s assertion that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned in [[1995]] and snapped at her about it. 
[[File:Parvati Patil headshot.jpg|thumb|226x226px|[[Parvati Patil]], her roommate]]
When Lavender began dating Ron Weasley, she was very upset and confided in Harry about her feelings. Once they broke up however, Hermione chose to not display open affection towards Ron so Lavender's feelings would not get hurt. She also came to Lavender's rescue during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], blasting [[Fenrir Greyback]] away from her.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Unfortunately Lavender was mortally wounded by Greyback and was already dead by the time Hermione reached her. It can be assumed that Hermione was at least saddened by Lavenders death.

Hermione had a less tumultuous relationship with Parvati, although the two were not close. During Hermione's first year at Hogwarts, she hugged Parvati after Harry caught the Snitch at a [[Quidditch]] game. Parvati was noted to feel guilty after laughing at Ron's cruel teasing of Hermione in [[Transfiguration]], and the two discussed Hermione's attendance of the [[Slug Club Christmas party]] with [[Cormac McLaggen]]. As Parvati looked “''positively agog''” at Hermione confiding in her,&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; it can be assumed that Hermione seldom discussed personal matters with her room mates.

====Cormac McLaggen====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|What's happened to you?|Hermione|Oh, I've just escaped — I mean, I've just left Cormac. Under the mistletoe... Cormac hasn't asked me one single question about myself, no, I've just been treated to 'A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen' non-stop ever since — oh no, here he comes!|Hermione avoiding her date|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Cormac McLaggen HBPF.jpg|252x252px|thumb|left|Cormac McLaggen]]

[[Cormac McLaggen]] was a [[Gryffindor]] student one year above Hermione. The two became acquainted in [[1996]] through the [[Slug Club]], of which they were both members, though Hermione did not think highly of McLaggen. When she overheard him insulting [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] during [[Quidditch]] try-outs, Hermione struck him with the [[Confundus Charm]], undermining his abilities as a [[Keeper]]. 

Later in the year, when Hermione was furious with Ron for dating [[Lavender Brown]], she decided to attend [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] with McLaggen because she knew Ron despised him. McLaggen was apparently interested in Hermione, as he escorted her to the party and was very forward with her romantically while there. This, as well as his tendency to boast about himself, put Hermione off, and she soon abandoned him for the company of [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]] before leaving the party altogether to avoid him.&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; It can be assumed that the party was the end of their interaction.

[[File:Cho Chang.jpg|thumb|Cho Chang in her fifth year]]

====[[Cho Chang]]====
{{Quote|Well, obviously, she's feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. Then I expect she's feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can't work out who she likes best.|Hermione defending Cho's mental anguish to Ron Weasley|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
Hermione had a two sided history with Cho; while Hermione offered [[Harry Potter|Harry]] advice for making his relationship with Cho successful, Cho thought that Hermione's friendship with Harry was romantic and got increasingly jealous of her since Harry spends so much time with her. Hermione has no grudges for Cho however and was not angry at her when Harry told Hermione that Cho insulted her, instead rather cross at Harry for messing up his own relationship. When Harry arrives at the [[Room of Requirement]] with Ron and Hermione, shortly after the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] all hard feelings seemed to have been forgotten or forgiven as Cho greeted Hermione in a friendly way, probably since Cho had long broke up with Harry. The two seemed to be on neutral terms.

===Enemies===
====Lord Voldemort====
{{Quote|Harry, he has overpowered the Ministry, the newspapers, and half the wizarding community! Don't let him enter your mind, too!|Hermione Granger regarding Voldemort|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Voldemort Headshot DHP1.png|left|thumb|221x221px|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], her enemy]]
Hermione first learned about Lord Voldemort, the most dangerous [[Dark Wizard]] of all time, after reading about him sometime before she began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. During her first year, she and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] helped [[Harry Potter]] reach the [[Philosopher's Stone]] and protect it from Voldemort. 

A year later, Hermione, after fully recovering from her Polyjuice mishap, was shown [[T. M. Riddle's Diary]] by Harry. At first enthusiastic that the book might have "magical powers", Hermione first came up with the theory that it was Tom Riddle who originally "caught" the "Heir of Slytherin" when the [[Chamber of Secrets]] had been opened fifty years prior. She also correctly guessed that the Diary contained the answers to the Chamber's location, how to open it, and the true identity of Slytherin's monster. Thinking that the Diary was written in invisible ink, the attempted to use the spell ''[[Revealing Charm|Aparecium]]'', and then a [[Revealer]], on the object, but to no effect. Later on, when Harry went to the trophy room to try to learn more about Tom Riddle, he was accompanied by an "interested" Hermione. When Ron compared Riddle to Percy "in disgust", mentioning the former as being "''Prefect, Head Boy... probably at the top of every class''", Hermione responded in a "slightly hurt" voice, "''You say that like it's a bad thing.''"  

Later on, she also correctly deduced that Riddle had "caught the wrong person", and that "''it was some other monster'' [not Hagrid's [[Acromantula]], [[Aragog]]] ''that was killing people''". Later on, after Harry mentioned "hearing the voice" again before the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, Hermione ran immediately to the Library to research, where realised that Slytherin's monster was a Basilisk. Tearing the page out of the book, and putting it in her right hand, she left the Library, where she warned the first person she met, Penelope Clearwater, to look around corners with her mirror. However, both Hermione and Penelope were petrified  by [[Serpent of Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]], which was controlled by Tom Riddle's memory. 

In [[1995]], she learned that the Dark Lord had returned and supported Harry against the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]'s denial and smear campaign. She also fought in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] to prevent Voldemort from obtaining a vital [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]], but was severely injured and rendered unconscious. In [[1997]], she left Hogwarts to help Harry and Ron find and destroy Voldemort's horcruxes. She personally destroyed [[Hufflepuff's Cup|Helga Hufflepuff's Cup]] using a [[Serpent of Slytherin|Basilisk]]'s fang. She later witnessed Harry's defeat of Voldemort in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

However, Hermione made very little direct contact with Voldemort, truly seeing him for the first time during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. Possibly the closest connection Hermione and Voldemort shared was through the former wearing [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]] whilst travelling with [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] in 1997. The [[Horcrux]] locket was worn by all three for regular, though limited, periods of time, inadvertently allowing the portion of soul within to access the wearer's thoughts, emotions and deepest fears. The Horcrux had learned enough about Hermione to use hers and Harry's likenesses in emotionally torturing Ron, reflecting Ron's deepest fears of Hermione preferring Harry to him. Because the Horcrux had become so disconnected from the once whole soul of [[Tom Riddle]], the physically bodied Voldemort was not aware of any of these events, nor of the information the Horcrux had gained dangling around the necks of Harry and his closest friends. 

Although they had very little direct contact, Hermione and Voldemort are sometimes similar: both are "''model students''" who achieved outstanding grades in NEWTS. Both were Prefects, although Voldemort was Head Boy while Hermione skipped school during what would have been her seventh year due to political persecution, preventing her from being Head Girl that year (it is possible that Hermione became Head Girl when she went back to finish her seventh year after Voldemort's final destruction). They both came from Muggle backgrounds, but Voldemort was raised in an orphanage while Hermione was brought up in a loving Muggle family.

====Bellatrix Lestrange====
{{Quote|You're lying, filthy mud-blood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault in Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth! What else did you take? What else have you got? Tell me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife! What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! ''CRUCIO''!|Bellatrix interrogating Hermione|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Bellatrix Lestrange promo.jpg|228x228px|thumb|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]], a hated enemy]]

Bellatrix Lestrange was one of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s most fanatically loyal followers; Hermione initially knew her as one of the [[Death Eaters]] involved in torturing and permanently incapacitating [[Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Alice Longbottom]], though she also witnessed Bellatrix murder [[Sirius Black]] at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], in [[1996]].

During the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]], Bellatrix chose to torture Hermione, who, as a Muggle-born, Bellatrix felt was most dispensable (though, as a "''blood traitor,''" Ron Weasley was a close second), in order to discover where and how the trio had managed to acquire [[Sword of Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor's Sword]]. During the interrogation, Bellatrix used her knife to carve the word "''mudblood''" on Hermione's arm,&lt;ref name="DHF1"&gt;{{DH|F1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as torturing her sadistically with the [[Cruciatus Curse]].&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Hermione later used one of Bellatrix's hairs obtained in the skirmish to make [[Polyjuice Potion]] and [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)|break into]] the [[Lestrange Vault]] at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]]. She expressed disgust at having to  use Bellatrix's wand knowing the crimes Bellatrix commited with it. Hermione, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]] duelled against Bellatrix during the final battle, but were made to stand aside by [[Molly Weasley]], who eventually killed Bellatrix herself.

====Draco Malfoy====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione Granger|Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you evil —|Ron Weasley|Hermione!|Get off, Ron!|Hermione after slapping Draco for mocking a distraught Hagrid|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Draco Malfoy (HBP promo).jpg|243x243px|thumb|[[Draco Malfoy]], her school bully|left]]
Draco Malfoy, of an old and wealthy [[pure-blood]] [[Malfoy family|family]] with [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] ties, was raised to believe in the inferiority of [[Muggle-born]]s, and thus treated Hermione with disdain. This was probably exacerbated by Hermione's friendship with Harry and Ron, who shared a strong enmity with Draco from virtually the moment they met, and her beating Draco in school marks, for which his [[Lucius Malfoy|father]] berated him.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; Draco frequently called Hermione the disparaging term "[[Mudblood]]," which usually set off the tempers of her friends — and the entire [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch team]] when he first said it to her face in [[1992]]&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; — but Hermione tended to ignore Draco and urged Harry and Ron to do the same. 

Occasionally she would snap back at him, and in their third year, she even slapped&lt;!-- ATTENTION: DON'T change this to "punched." Within the wiki canon policy, the books supersede the films. Hermione never punched him in the book.--&gt; him when he mocked [[Rubeus Hagrid]] for being upset over the impending execution of [[Buckbeak]], for which Draco was largely responsible.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt;

In spite of his prejudice and dislike toward Hermione, Draco was reluctant to confirm her identity when he was asked to do so by his parents and aunt [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] in [[1998]], avoiding even looking at her. As an adult sobered by his wartime experiences, Draco was civil towards Hermione and her friends, and friendly with her nephew, Albus Potter.&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt;He even found the idea of taking orders from her during their ambush in 1981 of Delphini to be darkly humorous. Draco's civility towards Hermione during this time was likely reinforced due to her being the Minister For Magic in Britain at the time, and possibly due to her relations to Albus Potter, the best friend of his own son, Scorpius. 

====Pansy Parkinson====
{{Quote|Stunningly pretty? ''Her''? What was she judging against — a chipmunk?|Pansy about Hermione when her looks are complimented in an article|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[File:Pansy Parkinson infobox.png|218x218px|thumb|Pansy Parkinson]]

[[Pansy Parkinson]] was more or less Hermione's polar opposite: where Hermione was compassionate (as seen when she founded [[Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare|SPEW]]), independent, and incredibly helpful to nearly anyone who needed it, Pansy was petty and spiteful, who mocked just about every non-Slytherin student she encountered (as well as [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]), and was little more than one of Draco Malfoy's more sycophantic [[Draco Malfoy's gang|lackeys]]. Pansy had a tendency to taunt and snipe at Hermione, [[Harry Potter|Harry]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] at any given opportunity, though Hermione rarely seemed more than slightly irritated by her comments; the major exception to that most likely would have been Pansy's attempt to surrender Harry to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] shortly prior to the start of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Hermione had a scathing opinion of Pansy, believing her to be be a "cow", and "thicker than a concussed troll".&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt;

====Rita Skeeter====
{{Quote|I ''hate'' that Skeeter woman! I'll get her back for this if it's the last thing I do!| Hermione vows retribution against Rita Skeeter|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[File:Rita Skeeter 2.jpg|221x221px|thumb|left|[[Rita Skeeter]]]]

While covering the [[Triwizard Tournament]] in Hermione's fourth year, [[Daily Prophet]] journalist [[Rita Skeeter]] wrote a number of exaggerated and slanderous stories about [[Harry Potter]] and his friends, including one that outed [[Rubeus Hagrid]] as a [[half-giant]]. Harry and Hermione angrily confronted Rita about this. After Hermione insulted her, Rita published another article that portrayed Hermione as manipulative and ambitious, claiming that she was toying with the emotions of both Harry Potter and [[Viktor Krum]]. This resulted in Hermione receiving several letters of hate mail, including a few [[Howler]]s and at least one envelope filled with [[bubotuber pus]].

Hermione became obsessed with getting back at Rita and uncovering how she was getting all of her information. Finally, near the end of the school year Hermione realised that Rita Skeeter was an unregistered [[Animagus]]. She caught Rita in her beetle form attempting to eavesdrop on Harry in the [[Hospital Wing]] after the [[Triwizard Tournament|Third Task]]. Hermione sealed her inside a small bottle. Hermione blackmailed Rita into giving up writing for one year, otherwise her unregistered status would be revealed. As the penalties are apparently quite severe, Rita had no choice but to comply.

When the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] began using the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' in its smear campaign against Harry, Hermione was again able to blackmail Rita, this time into writing an article for ''[[The Quibbler]]'' that would allow Harry to tell his side of the story. After her one year punishment was over, Rita went back to writing with as much enthusiasm and as little scruples as she had before, although it's unknown if she ever crossed Hermione again. Given her notable lack of commentary regarding Hermione during the 2014 Quidditch World Cup in Egypt, it is likely that Rita remained extremely wary of Hermione's wrath 19 years following her being blackmailed by the prodigious witch.

===Organisations===
====Dumbledore's Army====
{{Quote|I also think we should have a name... It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don't you think?|Hermione on naming the Army|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[File:Dumbledore%27s_Army.jpg|240x240px|thumb|[[Dumbledore's Army]], her allies]]

Dumbledore's Army was essentially Hermione's brainchild, though she co-founded it with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Harry Potter|Harry]] during the [[1995–1996 school year]]. After [[Dolores Umbridge]] informed her [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] students that they would not be using any magic, claiming a theoretical education would suffice, a furious Hermione (fearful of being ill-equipped to deal with the reborn [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the upcoming [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]s) conceived of the organisation as a means of allowing any student interested in actually practising defensive magic to do so. Though the secret classes were taught by Harry, Hermione arranged the initial meeting at the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], created the DA's method of covert [[Dumbledore's Army coin|communication]], and [[Dumbledore's Army parchment jinx|jinxed]] their member list to reveal any betrayal. 

All of the DA members grew closer over the course of the year (with the exceptions of [[Marietta Edgecombe]], who betrayed the DA to Umbridge, and later [[Zacharias Smith]], who deserted them), as evidenced by their reunion in [[1997]], and their enthusiasm in supporting Harry and mobilising against the invading Death Eaters during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Moreover, the DA truly cemented Hermione's friendships with [[Luna Lovegood]] and [[Neville Longbottom]], who were the only members, aside from [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], to fight alongside Hermione, Harry, and Ron at the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] and the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]].

====Order of the Phoenix====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-c|Harry Potter|What is this place anyway?|Ron Weasley|Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix.|Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix — ?|Hermione|It's a secret society. Dumbledore's in charge, he founded it. It's the people who fought against You-Know-Who last time.|Hermione explaining to Harry the Order|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}} 
[[File:Order of the Phoenix – first generation.jpg|250px|thumb|The original [[Order of the Phoenix]], her allies|left]]
Hermione first heard about the Order of the Phoenix in 1995, when she, [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] spent several weeks at [[12 Grimmauld Place|the Order's headquarters]]. Through her time at Grimmauld Place, Hermione got to know [[Alastor Moody]], the most famous [[Auror]] of modern times, known for rounding up several [[Death Eaters]] after the [[First Wizarding War]] and for his growing paranoia. He and Hermione fought together in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], and later, in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], where Moody was killed by Voldemort's own hand. Hermione, like the rest of the Order, was shocked and horrified by the death of such a skilled Auror, "''the consummate survivor'',"&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; and disgusted by [[Mundungus Fletcher]]'s desertion. Hermione, who had known Fletcher as a petty criminal who had stolen a number the Black family heirlooms shortly after [[Sirius Black]]'s death, aside from being a member of the Order, took part in interrogating Fletcher, when she, Harry and Ron realised [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]] had been among the items stolen from Grimmauld Place.

Hermione had great respect for [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], a skilled Auror and eventual [[Minister for Magic]], who was known as "Royal" on ''[[Potterwatch]]'', and who saved countless lives (including Hermione, Ron and Harry's) when he sent his [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] to warn the attendees of [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|Bill and Fleur's wedding]] that the Ministry had fallen, and with it, the protections surrounding [[the Burrow]]. Another member of the Order responsible for saving the trio was [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], Albus' younger brother. Though Hermione, Harry and Ron had known him for some time as the owner of the [[Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head Pub]], they finally met him in [[1998]], just before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], when he just barely managed to get them out a trap set by [[Death Eaters]]. Prior to that, he sent Dobby to rescue them, along with [[Dean Thomas]], [[Luna Lovegood]], [[Garrick Ollivander]] and [[Griphook]] the Goblin, from the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]]; as it turned out, Aberforth had acquired Sirius Black's [[two-way mirror]] from Mundungus Fletcher, and been keeping an eye out for Harry.

[[Nymphadora Tonks]], a funny, [[Metamorphmagus]] witch, who had become a good friend of Hermione's, died along with her husband and fellow member of the Order, [[Remus Lupin]], during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. As their son, [[Edward Lupin|Ted Lupin]], was Harry's godson and was also dating Hermione's niece, [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]] by 2017, it's likely Hermione remained quite close to him.

===Professors and other Hogwarts staff===
====Albus Dumbledore====
{{Quote|Second — to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points!|Dumbledore awarding Hermione last-minute points at the feast at the end of her first year|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Albus Dumbledore]], her former headmaster]]
As with most aspects of the [[wizarding world]], Hermione read about [[Albus Dumbledore]] shortly after learning that she was a [[Wizardkind|witch]]. Hermione on her very first train journey revealed she wanted to be in Gryffindor because it was the house that Dumbledore belonged to. She first met the Hogwarts headmaster during her her first year at the school, in [[1991]], and quickly came to respect Dumbledore's immense power and seemingly infinite wisdom. Although Dumbledore was not as close with her as he was with [[Harry Potter]], he showed great insight into her character very early on. She was one of only three students Dumbledore bequeathed a personal item, as he believed her to be, along with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], trustworthy of accompanying Harry on his mission to destroy [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es.

He respected her intellect, perspicacity, and level-headedness, admitting to Harry that he had counted on Hermione to keep things in perspective when the trio finally discovered the existence of the [[Deathly Hallows]]. Hermione was devastated when Dumbledore was killed, and visited his [[Albus Dumbledore's portrait|portrait]] with Harry and Ron after the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] to determine the fate of the Hallows.

====Rubeus Hagrid====
{{Quote|Then I'll go back again tomorrow. I'll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don't care if [[Dolores Umbridge|she]] throws out [[Sybill Trelawney|Trelawney]] but she's not getting rid of Hagrid.|Hermione defending Hagrid against Umbridge|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Rubeus Hagrid.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Rubeus Hagrid]], her friend and professor|left]]
Rubeus Hagrid was the [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|gamekeeper]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]] professor at Hogwarts, as well as a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the [[First Wizarding War|First]] and [[Second Wizarding War]]s. Since Hagrid had met [[Harry Potter]] prior to the start of Hermione's first year at Hogwarts, Hermione grew closer to Hagrid as her friendship with Harry developed, eventually coming to visit him in his [[Hagrid's Hut|hut]] regularly with Harry and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. In their second year, Hagrid comforted Hermione when she was called a "''a filthy little mudblood''" by Draco Malfoy. 

Though she disapproved of Hagrid's penchant for collecting dangerous [[Creature|pets]], she tended to more pro-actively support him in his efforts to care for them than Harry and Ron, as when Hagrid was attempting to appeal the execution of [[Buckbeak]] and raise his half-brother [[Grawp]]. In turn, it was Hagrid who encouraged Ron and Harry to re-think their treatment of Hermione when the three had a brief falling out over Hermione getting Harry's new [[Firebolt]] confiscated in their third year. When [[Dolores Umbridge]] threatened Hagrid's job during the 1995-1996 school year, Hermione advised him to teach only materials related to their O.W.Ls, so as not to give Umbridge any excuse to fire him, and worked tirelessly to keep him on track.

Hagrid remained close to the trio throughout their time at Hogwarts, and fought various battles in the course of the [[Second Wizarding War]]. In [[2017]], Harry's sons planned to meet Hagrid in his hut for tea soon after arriving at school, and it's very likely that Hermione and Ron's [[Rose Granger-Weasley|daughter]] would have been joining them.

====Remus Lupin====
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione|Harry! How could you?|Ron Weasley|You shouldn't have said that stuff to Lupin.|Hermione and Ron, after Harry yells at Remus for leaving his wife|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Remus Lupin Deathly Hallows promo image.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Remus Lupin]], her professor and friend]]
Hermione was among the students who were very impressed by Remus Lupin's teaching in 1993, when he was appointed [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor. Hermione deduced he was a [[werewolf]] during the school year, yet chose to keep it a secret in order to respect his privacy. Towards the end of the year, however, Lupin admitted that he was a werewolf to Harry, Ron and Hermione whilst in the [[Shrieking Shack]]. Following the events in this dilapidated building, Lupin became fully prepared to help [[Sirius Black]] kill [[Peter Pettigrew]], the wizard who betrayed [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]] to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. 

However, thanks to Harry's intervention, they chose not to commit the murder, inadvertently allowing Pettigrew to escape. Lupin had referred to Hermione as the cleverest witch of her age he had ever seen before to this. Hermione, meanwhile, did not concern herself with Lupin's lycanthropy, she judged him only by his good nature and the content of his character.

Hermione met Lupin again in 1995 at the [[12 Grimmauld Place|Headquarters]] of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. She and Lupin both fought against the [[Death Eaters]] during the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in 1996, and survived (despite Hermione being side-swiped by Dolohov's curse). They also fought in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] alongside, both emerging alive and relatively unscathed on the two occasions. Hermione was pleased to learn that Lupin had married [[Nymphadora Tonks]] before the Battle of the Seven Potters began, and became even more joyful at the news of Lupin's son, [[Edward Lupin|Ted Lupin]], being born; joining in on the celebratory festivities at [[Shell Cottage]]. Hermione was devastated by Lupin's and Tonks' [[death]]s in 1998, becoming friendly with their orphaned son, [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]], later on in life.

====Minerva McGonagall====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Professor McGonagall|Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?|Harry Potter|Hermione. We haven't seen her for ages, Professor, and we thought we'd sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry.|Of course. Of course, I realise this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been… I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger, I will inform Professor Binns where you've gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given you permission.|Professor Minerva McGonagall softening when Harry and Ron tell her they want to visit Hermione|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[File:Mcgonagall.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Minerva McGonagall]], her Head of House and professor|left]]
Professor Minerva McGonagall took a shine to Hermione from the first class she had with her, granting the first-year student in [[Gryffindor|her house]] one of her "''rare smiles''" when Hermione successfully [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] a match into a needle early on in the lesson and long before any other student. She had high expectations for Hermione, and was thus disappointed in her when Hermione claimed she tried to fight the [[troll]] that entered the school in [[1991]] on her own, in order to cover up for Harry and Ron. Whenever Hermione and her friends would get into trouble, McGonagall almost inevitably looked to Hermione to be the most sensible one.&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; 

McGonagall was noticeably upset when Hermione was [[petrification|Petrified]] in [[1993]], even granting Harry and Ron permission to skip a class so they could visit Hermione in the hospital wing.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; The [[1993–1994 school year|following school year]], she helped arrange for Hermione to be granted a [[Time-Turner]] to take extra classes.&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; When the professor was injured with four [[Stunning Spell]]s in [[1996]], Hermione was very upset and worried for her.&lt;ref name="OOTP" /&gt; Hermione seemed to regard her head of house as a role model, while Professor McGonagall, in spite of her sternness, was obviously quite fond of Hermione and expected great things of her.

Later, after McGonagall became headmistress of Hogwarts and Hermione became a member of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], McGonagall granted her permission to use notes left to the Hogwarts Archives, written by [[Albus Dumbledore]], in her re-translation of {{TBB}}, demonstrating McGonagall's trust in her former pupil.

====Severus Snape====
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|Please, sir, the [[werewolf]] differs from the true [[wolf]] in several small ways.The snout of the werewolf —|Severus Snape|That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger, Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.|Snape insulting Hermione|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Severus Snape.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Severus Snape]], her professor]]
Severus Snape was the [[Potions (class)|Potions]] [[Potions Master|Master]] during most of Hermione's time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. He was also the [[Head of Slytherin House]], and tended to openly show preferential treatment for the students of his own house, while being quick to criticise and deduct points from [[Gryffindor]] students. He was particularly unpleasant towards the trio, and regularly punished and verbally assaulted Harry and Ron for their poor to mediocre performances in his class. He could not do the same to Hermione, as she was the best student in the year and instead mocked her for things like being an "''insufferable know-it-all,''"&lt;ref name="POA" /&gt; once even snidely insulting the size of Hermione's teeth.&lt;ref name="GOF" /&gt;

Despite his pre-existing dislike for Gryffindor,&lt;ref name="DH" /&gt; Snape's treatment of Hermione likely had more to do with her close friendship with Harry. Despite this, Hermione was still seen to defend Snape on occasion when Harry and Ron blamed him for evil deeds which occurred in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], like setting the troll in the dungeon and trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone in Harry's first year. In her fifth year she defended Snape while Ron expressed distrust of him, citing the number of times they were wrong about Snape wanting to harm them. After Dumbledore's death, she like many, believed that Snape was a coward who killed a man who trusted him more than anyone. It is unknown exactly how she reacted to learning of Snape's true motives and allegiance, but given her personality, it is highly likely that she came to both forgive her former Professor's cruelty, and even admire him for his bravery.

====Dolores Umbridge====
{{Quote|That foul, lying, twisting old gargoyle! You see what she's up to? It's her thing about half-breeds all over again — she's trying to make out Hagrid's some kind of dim-witted troll, just because he had a giantess for a mother —|Hermione expressing her hatred of Umbridge, over Umbridge's persecution of Hagrid|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Dolores Umbridge.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Dolores Umbridge]], her former professor and enemy|left]]
Dolores Umbridge was appointed [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], in [[1995]]. She was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students using the [[Black Quill]], most notably when she forced [[Harry Potter]] to carve ''"I must not tell lies''" into the back of his own hand. Umbridge was as obsessed with blood-status as the [[Death Eaters]], and had a particular hatred of what she called "''half-breeds''." Hermione, like most of the students and staff at Hogwarts, hated Umbridge. Hermione was one of the first to pick up on the true motives behind Umbridge's appointment at the magical school. In turn, Umbridge was not too fond of Hermione, who was not only [[Muggle-born]], but was also probably far too perceptive for her liking, as well as being outspokenly opposed to a purely theoretical [[Defence Against the Dark Arts|defensive]] magical education. 

When Umbridge planned to use [[Veritaserum]] and then the [[Cruciatus Curse]] on Harry, Hermione was the one who came up with the lie that led to them venturing into the [[Forbidden Forest]] and Umbridge eventually being dragged away by a [[Forbidden Forest Centaur colony|herd of offended centaurs]].

Hermione next met Umbridge a second time at the Ministry of Magic in 1997, when Hermione was disguised as [[Mafalda Hopkirk]] through the usage of [[Polyjuice Potion]]. Umbridge was, at the time, interrogating "Mudblood" witches and wizards, prior to sending them to [[Azkaban]]. Harry stunned Umbridge and retrieved [[Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]], one of Voldemort's hocruxes which Umbridge had taken from [[Mundungus Fletcher]] and was attempting to pass off as a family heirloom and proof of her relation to the [[Selwyn family]]. Hermione replaced the locket by duplicating it with the Geminio spell so Umbridge would not know that it had been taken from her. The trio proceeded to free all the Muggle-Borns awaiting interrogation.

Suffice it to say that Umbridge personified everything that Hermione detested and loathed in Wizarding society, including but not limited to racial prejudice, sadism, malicious misuse of power, authoritarianism, and pure-blood supremacy.

====Septima Vector====
[[File:Professor Vector PSF.jpg|200px|thumb|Septima Vector, her Arithmancy professor]]
{{Quote|I heard her talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going on about yesterday's lesson...|Ron Weasley having witnessed Hermione talking to Professor Vector|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
Hermione also had a good relationship with her [[Arithmancy]] [[Septima Vector|Professor Septima Vector]]. Many students disliked Vector because of her strictness. However, Hermione said Arithmancy was her favourite subject at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She also never complained about Vector's strictness. During her [[third year]], Hermione joined her class and used a [[time-turner]] to get to one of the lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{POA|B|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in her [[fourth year]], Hermione and the other students got no homework from Septima Vector on the first day of term,&lt;ref&gt;{{GOF|B|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she adamantly refused to skive Arithmancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{GOF|B|20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Rowling took Hermione's name from William Shakespeare's ''{{w|The Winter's Tale}}'',&lt;ref name="TNPC1999"&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-pressclubtransc.htm Transcript of National Press Club author's luncheon, NPR Radio, 20 October, 1999] ''Accio-quote.org'' Retrieved on 23 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; saying that she wanted it to be unusual, since if fewer girls shared her name, fewer girls would get teased for it.&lt;ref name="TNPC1999" /&gt; Rowling's knowledge and interest in Greek mythology may have also influenced her choice in regards to Hermione's name. In 1988, Rowling wrote a short essay about her time studying classics entitled "''What was the Name of that Nymph Again? or Greek and Roman Studies Recalled''"; it was published by the University of Exeter's journal ''Pegasus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wikilink|J. K. Rowling#Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Hermione" is derived from "Hermes", who was the messenger of the Greek gods, as well as the god of wit, eloquence and quick thinking.

'Hermione' is the female derivative of 'Hermes', a messenger god known for his sharp wit and ability to transition between worlds. Quite fittingly, Hermione transitioned between the Muggle and wizarding worlds, delivered information, and was pretty sharp-witted herself.
[[File:Hermione Granger HBPF promo 5.jpg|thumb|Hermione in her [[1996|sixth year]]]]
{{W|Hermione (mythology)|Hermione}} is also the name of another figure from Greek mythology, who was the princess of Sparta and the only daughter of Helen of Troy and King Menelaus. The name also appears in Jean-Baptiste Lully's play ''{{W|Cadmus et Hermione}}'', based on the story of the goddess of harmony, Harmonia, who married the founder of Thebes. 

In order to ensure that fans could correctly pronounce Hermione's name, a scene was created between Hermione and [[Viktor Krum]] in {{GOF}} in which they discuss the correct pronunciation; however, the closest Krum got was "Herm-own-ninny".&lt;ref name="ninny"&gt;[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1041946302215593984/ Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore|will]] of [[Albus Dumbledore]], Hermione's middle name was listed as "Jean"; however, in previous interviews, Rowling had stated that her middle name was "Jane". Rowling cleared this up in a later interview by stating that she had decided that she did not want Hermione to share a middle name with [[Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], and thus changed it to Jean, which is a female variant of the name John, meaning "God is gracious".&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;[http://www.behindthename.com/name/jean-2 Behind the Name:Jean]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{W|Granger (name)|Granger}} is another word for farmer; specifically, it was the title of a farm bailiff, who oversaw the collection of rent and taxes from the barns of a feudal lord. It is a surname of English and French origin, derived from the Anglo-Norman ''grainger'' and the French ''grangier'', both of which come from Latin ''granica'', meaning "granary". It recalls Hermione's [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] roots. Her original last name was "Puckle", but Rowling later decided this didn't suit her character.

Hermione may be named after {{W|Clive Granger|Sir Clive Granger}}, a Nobel Prize-winning British economist who taught in Britain at the University of Nottingham and described the "{{w|Granger causality}}". Or possibly after Granger, one of the society of people who memorised books in ''Fahrenheit 451''.

The reason of choosing such an uncommon name as Hermione for the character is because, according to Rowling, she did not bear getting any child mocked because of sharing a name with an "insufferable know-it-all" such as Hermione.

*Hermione is portrayed by French-born [[Great Britain|British]] actress [[Emma Watson]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film adaptations]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]'' and is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations. Watson also portrayed her in the short {{QH}}.
*Emma Watson actually had to dye her hair darker for the first three films. Emma naturally has light brown hair.
**Her hair changes every film, somehow, the cases being:
***In the first film, her hair is medium brown, straight, and very bushy.
***In the second film, her hair is longer than it ever was in the film series, has grown lighter (caramel brown), and is wavy, not straight.
***In [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|''The Prisoner of Azkaban'']], her hair is merely shoulder length and is shown to become curly.
***In ''The Goblet of Fire'', her hair has gone a bit bushy again and back to being gently wavy, along with being a lighter brown.
***In ''Order of the Phoenix'', Hermione's hair changes yet ''again'': it became almost straight, and its length now reaches just below armpit.
***In ''The Half-Blood Prince'', she is seen with a curlier tone  and hair that reaches a few inches above the earlier film.
***In the ''Deathly Hallows'' films, her hair becomes longer (chest-length) again, but reverts to being straight again, possibly due to the stress of being on the run. Notably, the second film features her hair becoming medium brown again.
*Hermione's hair colour in the last five films became lighter due to Emma Watson reverting to her natural hair colour.
*As Hermione said in {{GOF}}, she used to wear braces, presumingly in order to correct her dentition. This was then made unnecessary when she let Madam Pomfrey, while shrinking her teeth elongated by Draco Malfoy's ''[[Densaugeo]]'' [[hex]], "''carry on a little bit''". According to Hermione, Mr and Mrs Granger wouldn't"''be too pleased''" by this.
*According to {{OOTP}}, Hermione and all her family can ski, although when it comes to her it isn't "''really'' [her] ''thing''".
*Hermione is portrayed by British actress [[Noma Dumezweni]] in {{CC|P1}}.&lt;ref name="cast1"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3368162/Still-magic-middle-age-s-Harry-Potter-new-look-Hermione-Cast-set-star-highly-anticipated-stage-play-revealed.html Still magic in middle age... It's Harry Potter and a new-look Hermione: Cast set to star in highly-anticipated stage play is revealed]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sophie Thompson]] plays Hermione when she is disguised as [[Mafalda Hopkirk]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]], ''as does [[Helena Bonham Carter]] when she is disguised as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]''. [[Daniel Radcliffe]] also plays Hermione in the "Seven Potters" scene. However, Emma provided the voice for Hermione while she was in disguise on all three occasions.
*Although the novels describe Hermione as having rather large front teeth in her younger years, this is not depicted in the films, as Watson never had large teeth and couldn't speak when applied with bucked teeth.
*However, in an on-screen commentary for the Blu-Ray release of ''Philosopher's Stone'', reveals that the final scene of the film ''does'' show Hermione's large front teeth. According to Columbus, the scene - which was actually the first to be shot - was filmed with Emma Watson wearing fake teeth to simulate the look of Hermione, but that after filming the sequence it was decided to continue using them would have been impractical. Via edits, the appearance of Hermione's teeth is minimised, but they are still visible when she speaks in the scene.
*Also, Hermione's hair is only shown as bushy for the first film. Later, her hair is shown as wavy in the second film, and curly in the third film onwards, although it does briefly take on a bushy appearance for comedic effect during the potion-making contest sequence of the film ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', the film is the second one featuring Hermione with curly hair, after {{POA}}.
{{Quote|Hermione's Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gambolling around her. "They are sort of nice, aren't they?" she said, looking at it fondly.|Hermione's Patronus|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
*Hermione's [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], an [[otter]], is Rowling's favourite animal. The otter is in the family ''Mustelidae'', the same as the weasel, although the latter do not live near water.
*Hermione is rendered Hermelien in Dutch and Hermine in German. They in turn are similar to the words Hermelijn in Dutch and Hermelin in German, which means Stoat, which is a species of Weasel.
*In {{DH}}, Hermione tells [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] that she is not planning to pursue career in Magical Law. Ironically, that's where she ends up after leaving Hogwarts, following a stint in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
*In early drafts, Hermione was supposed to have [[Hermione Granger's sister|a Muggle sister]].&lt;ref name="EBF" /&gt; In a 2004 interview with the BBC on World Book Day, J.K. Rowling revealed the following: 'I always planned that Hermione would have a younger sister but she's never made an appearance and somehow it feels like it might be too late now.' This would have made Hermione very similar to Lily Evans; both muggle-born Witches, both having a Muggle sister, both sorted into Gryffindor, both members of the Order of the Phoenix and both going on to marry pure-blood wizards (Lily marrying pure-blood James Potter and Hermione marrying pure-blood Ron Weasley).
*On several occasions - during their frequent bickering - Hermione is seen calling Ron by his full name to express her annoyance. Some examples include her squabble with Ron about [[Peter Pettigrew|Scabbers]] (''"Ronald has lost his rat"''), and when they argue about Ron's sister [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] dating [[Dean Thomas]] ''("Honestly Ronald, they're just holding hands - and snogging"'').
*Hermione admitted to successfully trying out "a few simple spells" just before her [[first year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]],&lt;ref name="PS" /&gt; but, in spite of [[underage magic]] being banned, she apparently never received a warning from the [[Improper Use of Magic Office]] for it. This may be because, since she had not yet attended Hogwarts as an official student, the Ministry overlooked it just as they overlooked when young [[Tom Riddle]] used magic before attending Hogwarts to move objects, help him climb down a steep cliff, etc.; and also as they overlooked when young [[Harry Potter|Harry]] made the glass of the boa constrictor cage disappear, made his own hair grow back to normal long length after [[Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] cut it, etc. Severus Snape indicated as much to Lily Evans when they were both children about Lily's own use of magic before she was a student.
*The screenwriter for {{COS|FA}}, [[Steve Kloves]] has said that Hermione is his favourite character, commenting: "There's something about her fierce intellect coupled with a complete lack of understanding of how she affects people sometimes that I just find charming and irresistible to write."&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt;
*In {{COS|FA}}, Hermione is shown to be aware of what the term "[[Mudblood]]" means when [[Draco Malfoy]] uses the slur against her, whereas in the novel, she has never heard the word before and Ron explains its meaning to her and Harry.
*In {{COS}}, Professor Binns calls Hermione "Miss Grant". It is also made known that Binns calls everyone different names, with Binns also calling Harry Potter "Mr Perkins".
{{Quote|Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the Boggart in it. After about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming. "Hermione!" said Lupin, startled. "What's the matter?" "P-P-Professor McGonagall!" Hermione gasped, pointing into the trunk. "Sh-she said I'd failed everything!"|Hermione's Boggart|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
*Hermione's [[Boggart]] in her third year was [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] telling her that she had "failed everything", which Rowling later commented showed that "underneath Hermione's snootiness there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure".&lt;ref name="JKRHG" /&gt;
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Hermione is shown to be wearing a pink set of dress robes rather than periwinkle blue, as in the novel.
*In {{HBP|FA}}, Hermione told [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]] and the Slug Club about her parents being [[dentist]]s, but no one, except Harry, knew what dentists were.
*Hermione shared a last name with potioneer [[Hector Dagworth-Granger]], though she informed [[Horace Slughorn]] that she did not think they were related, since she was [[Muggle-born]].&lt;ref name="HBP" /&gt; However, the theory that Muggle-borns have some sort of wizarding ancestry suggests Slughorn might be right about Hermione and Hector being related because every Muggle-born must have had a [[Squib]] ancestor.
*In {{DH}}, [[Harry Potter|Harry]] mentions that the only spell Hermione ever had trouble with was the [[Patronus Charm]], although she was among the first of the D.A. to master the spell and casts it successfully multiple times throughout the series. This may have something to do with the emotional nature of the spell; Harry, due to his inability to cut off his emotions, is particularly adept at this spell, while the logical Hermione has issues with it. It may also have something to do with the caster's self confidence as J.K. Rowling has stated that Hermione is afraid of failure and Harry's first powerful uses of the spell, at a Quidditch match and when he saved Sirius, seem more motivated by his confidence rather then a positive memory.
*In ''[[Harry, A History: The True Story of a Boy Wizard, His Fans, and Life Inside the Harry Potter Phenomenon|Harry, A History]]'', Rowling told [[Melissa Anelli]] that Steve Kloves had suspected something might happen between Hermione and Harry while reading {{DH}}: "He felt a certain pull between them at that point. And I think he's right. There are moments when [Harry and Hermione] touch, which are charged moments. One when she touches his hair as he sits on the hilltop reading about Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and [two] the moment when they walk out of the graveyard with their arms around each other. Now the fact is that Hermione shares moments with Harry that Ron will never be able to participate in. He walked out. She shared something very intense with Harry. So I think it could have gone that way."&lt;ref name="HAH" /&gt;
*Singer {{w|Katy B}} auditioned to play Hermione, but was dismissed when the casting director discovered that she had not read the books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nme.com/news/tabloid-hell/55802 "Katy B: 'I auditioned for Hermione role in 'Harry Potter&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; - Tabloid Hell"] at [http://www.nme.com/ NME]&lt;/ref&gt; {{w|Charlotte Church}} also auditioned, but was too old for the part.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_2985000/2985244.stm "Charlotte Church: 'I was nearly Hermione'"] at [http://www.bbc.com/ BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Watson says that her favourite scene during the film series is the Yule Ball sequence in the fourth film, just like Rupert Grint.
*In the Harry Potter books, Hermione has brown hair, but in the films she has more of a light brown.
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Hermione snaps at Harry when he tells her to give a message to Ron, saying "I'm not an owl". An owl is used for carrying messages, but her name, Hermione, drives from Hermes, the Greek messenger of the gods.
*In the same adaptation, the subplot of Hermione standing up for House-Elves rights was left out of the film adaptations entirely.
*In {{DH|F1}}, Hermione is shown leaving her parents house, however this is only ever mentioned in the books.
*In the same film, Hermione is shown to be able to play the piano, which she attempts to teach [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] to do while at Grimmauld Place.
*In the same adaptation, Bellatrix uses her knife to carve the word "Mudblood" into Hermione's arm during her interrogation. This was not inscribed in the book, but was an idea that Emma Watson came up with, along with Helena Bonham Carter.
*Hermione cries in seven of the eight films:
**First film: After Ron insulted her by saying she has no friends because she is a nightmare and hides in the girls' bathroom.
**Second film: When she, her friends and the other students cheer for Hagrid after he returns to Hogwarts from Azkaban at the end of the film.
**Third film: When she, Harry and Ron saw Buckbeak's apparent execution.
**Fourth film: After Ron ruined her night at the Yule Ball.
**Sixth film: When Ron started having a relationship with Lavender Brown and when Dumbledore died.
**Seventh film: When Ron abandoned her and Harry during the Horcrux hunt, and after Bellatrix has interrogated her and carved the word 'Mudblood' on her arm with [[Bellatrix Lestrange's knife|her knife]].
**Eighth film: When she is worried about Harry going into the [[Forbidden Forest]] to have Voldemort kill him.
*Hermione's surname was 'Puckle', in early drafts of Harry Potter. It was later changed to Granger.
*Initially, J.K. Rowling had stated that Hermione's middle name was "Jane". However, Rowling later changed it to "Jean" after deciding that she did not want Hermione to share a middle name with [[Dolores Umbridge]].&lt;ref name="Jean" /&gt;
*Hermione's [[Hermione Granger's wand|wand]] [[wand wood|wood]] of vine corresponds to her [[19 September|birthday]] in the Celtic calendar, which Rowling did intentionally as a connection between Hermione's wand, [[Harry Potter's wand|Harry's wand]], and [[Charles Weasley's wand|Ron's wand]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=18 Extra Stuff: Wands]" at {{JKRS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Celtic calendar, the vine was a symbol of passionate emotions in both extremes—happiness and wrath — and was connected to fulfilling goals and finding balance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/moonphasemagic/tp/Celtic_Tree_Months.htm About.com: Celtic Tree Months]&lt;/ref&gt;
*When asked, Rowling said that if Hermione looked into the [[Mirror of Erised]] in the summer of [[1997]], she would have seen herself, Harry, and Ron "alive and unscathed" and [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] defeated, and might also "see herself closely entwined with [[Ronald Weasley|a special person]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2006/0801-radiocityreading1.html 1 August 2006 Radio City Music Hall Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hermione is a playable character in the video game adaptions of ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (video game)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' (only in duel mode), and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (video game)|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastore.ea.com/DRHM/store?Action=DisplayProductDetailsPage&amp;SiteID=ea&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;ThemeID=718200&amp;Env=BASE&amp;productID=222902400 EAstore.ea.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In {{POA|GA}} for PC, Peeves refers to Hermione as "Grunge". He always uses the last names for his insulting versions in the games, producing: Potter = Potty, Weasley = Weasel, and Granger = Grunge.
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Hermione has the ability to control [[Crookshanks]] and translate ancient runes since first year, rather than third year.
*A variant of Hermione is available in the "Downloadable Character Pack" {{w|Downloadable content|DLC}} for {{LEGO|Y2}}. The variant is called "Hermione (Pink Dress)" because it portrays Hermione wearing the [[Hermione Granger's dress robes|pink dress]] she wore to the [[Yule Ball]] in {{GOF|FA}}.
*In the books, several times Ron and Hermione repeat phrases said by one another; for example, when Hermione, in {{PS}}, wanted to produce fire in order to destroy the Devil's Snare, Ron tells her: "Are you a witch or not?" meaning that they could make fire by their wands. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Ron expressed regret for not having Crookshanks there to stop the Whomping Willow and Hermione told him, "Are you a wizard or not?" leading Ron to levitate a stick into the tree's weak spot. Furthermore, during the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], Tonks said Ron was amazing, having defeated many Death Eaters. When Hermione looked surprised, Ron said: "Always that tone of surprise." Hermione says the same thing when Ron told her she was very beautiful, during Bill and Fleur's wedding.
*Curiously, Hermione (a Muggle-born witch) is said having passed the Apparition exam and thus having obtained the Licence to Apparate,&lt;ref name="HBP22" /&gt; whereas her best friend and future husband, Ron Weasley (a Pureblood wizard), is said having passed the Muggle driving exam, thus having obtained the Muggle driving licence.&lt;ref name="DHE" /&gt;

===Author's comments===
[[J. K. Rowling]] has said that she loosely based Hermione at the age of eleven on herself at the same age, though an exaggerated version:

:"''...none of the characters in the books are directly taken from life. Real people did inspire a few of them, but of course once they are on the page they become something completely different. But, yeah, Hermione is a caricature of what I was when I was eleven — a real exaggeration, I wasn't that clever — Hermione is a borderline genius at points — and I hope I wasn't that annoying... sometimes she is an incredible know-it-all.''"&lt;ref name="WBUR" /&gt;

Rowling has gone on to say that Hermione, Harry, and Ron are all "''a bit like different parts of my personality''" as well as her favourite characters, along with [[Rubeus Hagrid]], [[Albus Dumbledore]], [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], and [[Luna Lovegood]],&lt;ref name="EBF"&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0804-ebf.htm J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival, Sunday, August 15, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; and that Hermione and Dumbledore were the most useful characters for {{w|Exposition (literary technique)|exposition}}.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0302-newsround-mzimba.htm Chamber of Secrets DVD interview with Steve Kloves and J.K. Rowling, February 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; She also identified Hermione as "the most brilliant" of her group of friends and confirmed that "''Harry needs her badly''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0600-times-treneman.html 30 July 2000 Times Interview with J.K. Rowling]&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling has also said that she considers Hermione to be "''a very strong female character''," as well as "''the brightest character''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0101-oprah.html January 2001 Interview with ''O Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowling has also stated that, from a feminist point of view, she is very proud of Hermione. In her words, Hermione does not "play the game" in refusing to sacrifice parts of herself as she grows from a girl to a woman. Hermione never makes Ron "feel better" by pretending to be less than she is; she always preserves who she is and waits for Ron to catch up. In general, Rowling regards her as a heroine, but isn't sexy nor entirely sexless, but a "real girl."

Rowling admitted in an interview conducted by Emma Watson for the magazine ''Wonderland'' in February of 2014 that, with hindsight, she initially had some second thoughts on the suitability of Ron as a partner for Hermione and believes that in some ways, Harry might have made a better romantic partner for her:

:''"I wrote the Hermione-Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfilment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione [ended up] with Ron."''

She went on to say that she found the attraction itself plausible, but that the combative side of it might cause problems in an adult relationship as there was too much fundamental incompatibility. However, according to Rowling, they could "probably be alright" with a bit of marriage counselling, as Ron needed to work on his self-esteem issues while Hermione needed to learn to be less critical. She concluded with the statement that just like herself, the uptight Hermione had a real weakness for a funny man. Ultimately, Rowling stated she had no regrets putting them together and stated the two balanced each other out and truly love one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mugglenet.com/jkrint-wonderland-020714.shtml February 2014 Interview with ''Wonderland'']&lt;/ref&gt;
