He was a member of Gellert Grindelwald's Alliance, and was among the dark wizard's foremost acolytes.[2]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Physical appearance 3 Magical abilities and skills 4 Etymology 5 Behind the scenes 6 Appearances 7 Notes and references   Biography Krafft joined Gellert Grindelwald at some point prior to 1927 and became one of his acolytes. He travelled to Paris to help Grindelwald's plans in recruiting Credence Barebone. While in Paris, he helped overthrow and murder a Non-Magique family and take their home. Alongside Krall, Nagel and Abernathy, he helped take out their bodies in coffins.[1] He then attended Grindelwald's rally at the Lestrange Mausoleum in the Cimetière du Père-Lachaise. Krafft Disapparated away after crossing the enchanted fire that tested one's loyalty following the entrance of Aurors, and did not participate in the subsequent battle after that.[2]  Physical appearance Krafft wore a militaristic jacket, with a bunch of little trinkets for decoration on it.[3]  Magical abilities and skills Apparition: Kraft was capable of Apparition like most other accomplished adult wizards. He successfully Disapparated away from the Lestrange Mausoleum in 1927 to escape the battle there.[1] Etymology Krafft may be derived from the word "kraft", which in Swedish, Norwegian and Danish can be used to mean "power" or "force" depending on the context, or the German counterpart, in which it means just the former. Behind the scenes Krafft is portrayed by Simon Meacock in the second instalment of the Fantastic Beasts film series.[4] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 2 images related to Krafft.
