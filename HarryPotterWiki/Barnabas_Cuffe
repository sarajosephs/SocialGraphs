As a child, he was very interested in the news, and enjoyed Slughorn's exaggerated outakes on the Daily Prophet. He maintained a good relationship with Slughorn as he stated that Cuffe was always ready to take his owl on the day's news. He also enjoyed receiving vibes as a means of communication.[3] During Cuffe's leadership, the Daily Prophet was under a strong influence by the Ministry of Magic, which highly relied on the newspaper to assure the support of the British wizarding community.[4] Aside from being the paper's editor, Cuffe occasionally wrote articles for the Prophet. One such article, entitled "The Wizarding World in Mourning", covered the then-recent death of Albus Dumbledore.[5]  Etymology The name "Barnabas" is the Greek form of an Aramaic name. In Acts in the New Testament the byname Barnabas was given to a man named Joseph, a companion of Paul on his missionary journeys. The original Aramaic is unattested, but it may be from בּר נביא (bar naviya') meaning "son of the prophet", though in Acts 4:36 it is claimed that the name means "son of encouragement". As an English name, it came into occasional use after the 12th century.  Behind the scenes Barnabas Cuffe was portrayed by Roger C. Bailey in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.[6] It is possible, as he was a former Slug Club member, that he attended the Christmas party. In the original script from the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince his first name is misspelled Barnubas.[7] Appearances Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (First appearance) (Appears in photograph) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (Appears in photograph) Harry Potter Limited Edition (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Horace Slughorn became Potions Master in 1931. Slughorn resigned from his teaching position in 1981, meaning Cuffe would have been a member of the Slug Club by at least then.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 4 (Horace Slughorn)  ↑ Writing by J.
