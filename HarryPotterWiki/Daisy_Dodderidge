It was first used as a given name in the 19th century, at the same time many other plant and flower names were coined.  Behind the scenes Daisy Dodderidge's Wizard of the Month entry and Chocolate Frog Card from the video games gives her dates as 1467-1555, but the Wizard of the Coast Chocolate Frog Cards lists them as 1457-1555.[1][2][3] Appearances Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card) Wizard of the Month Harry Potter: Magic Awakened (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Wizard of the Month (Internet Archive) at J.
