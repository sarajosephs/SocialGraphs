Loxias gave it the name of "the Deathstick", and used it to vanquish his enemies. It is unknown who killed him, as - according to Albus Dumbledore - many claimed to have finished him off, including his own mother,[1] but from Xenophilius Lovegood's understanding of history, either Arcus or Livius seems to have done it, and thus became the next master of the Elder Wand.[3]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (First mentioned) The Tales of Beedle the Bard (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real) - Albus Dumbledore on "The Tale of the Three Brothers"  ↑ It is most likely that he owned another wand before the Elder Wand.  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 21 (The Tale of the Three Brothers)        Preceded by:Barnabas Deverill  Master of the Elder WandEighteenth century (most likely)  Succeeded by:Arcus or Livius        Known owners of the Deathly Hallows      Elder Wand   Death (manufacturer) · Antioch Peverell · Antioch Peverell's killer · Emeric the Evil · Egbert the Egregious · Godelot · Hereward · Barnabas Deverill · Loxias · Arcus or Livius · Mykew Gregorovitch · Gellert Grindelwald · Albus Dumbledore · Draco Malfoy (master only) · Tom Riddle (owner only) · Harry Potter · (Interred)   Resurrection Stone   Death (manufacturer) · Cadmus Peverell · (generations of Gaunts) · Corvinus Gaunt · Marvolo Gaunt · Morfin Gaunt · Tom Riddle · Albus Dumbledore · Harry Potter · (Lost)   Cloak of Invisibility   Death (manufacturer) · Ignotus Peverell · Ignotus Peverell's son · Iolanthe Potter · (generations of Potters) · Henry Potter · Fleamont Potter · James Potter I · Albus Dumbledore (owner only) · Harry Potter · James Potter II · Albus Potter             Categories         Categories:   Dark wizards    Elder Wand masters    Historical figures    Loxias family    Males    Murder victims    Murderers             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Português do Brasil Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
