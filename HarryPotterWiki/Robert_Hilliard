I’m Prefect Robert Hilliard, and I’m delighted to welcome you to RAVENCLAW HOUSE. Our emblem is the eagle, which soars where others cannot climb; our house colours are blue and bronze, and our common room is found at the top of Ravenclaw Tower, behind a door with an enchanted knocker. The arched windows set into the walls of our circular common room look down at the school grounds: the lake, the Forbidden Forest, the Quidditch pitch and the Herbology gardens. No other house in the school has such stunning views." — {{{2}}}  Robert Hilliard was a wizard who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry between 1985 and 1987. Sorted into Ravenclaw, he was made a Prefect by 1991, and welcomed first-years when they initially arrived in his House.[2]  Appearances Pottermore (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 Pottermore Introductions to Hogwarts Houses (Archived from  Pottermore)        Preceded by:Unknown, eventuallyChester Davies  Male prefect of Ravenclaw House(along with two other male Ravenclaws in different years taking the post)at least 1991—1992  Succeeded by:Unknown, eventuallyMarcus Turner         Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry      Head Boys and Girls   Albus Dumbledore · Tom Riddle · Minerva McGonagall · James Potter · Lily Evans · Bill Weasley · Jacob's sibling · Corey Hayden · Percy Weasley · Teddy Lupin   Prefects   Hannah Abbott · Penelope Clearwater · Angelica Cole · Jane Court · Chester Davies · Cedric Diggory · Albus Dumbledore · Gemma Farley · Jake Flinton · Anthony Goldstein · Hermione Granger · Nicolas Grimmett · Robert Hawking · Robert Hilliard · Remus Lupin · Ernie Macmillan · Draco Malfoy · Lucius Malfoy · Minerva McGonagall · Cyril Meakin · Eric Murley · Annalena Murk · Pansy Parkinson · Padma Patil · Damian Perriss · Tom Riddle · Felix Rosier · Edmund Spiers · Jonathan Spratt · Kevin Sterndale · Terry Strickland · Marcus Turner · Gabriel Truman · Bill Weasley · Charlie Weasley · Percy Weasley · Ron Weasley · Ryan Westrup · Mervyn Wynch · Unidentified Gryffindor Prefect (I) · Unidentified Gryffindor Prefect (II) · Unidentified Ravenclaw Prefect (I) · Unidentified Ravenclaw Prefect (II) · Unidentified Slytherin Prefect (I) · Unidentified Slytherin Prefect (II) · Unidentified Slytherin Prefect (III)             Categories         Categories:   1970s births    British or Irish individuals    Hogwarts prefects    Males    Ravenclaws    Sorted in the 1980s    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
