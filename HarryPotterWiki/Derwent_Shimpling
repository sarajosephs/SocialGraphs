He once ate an entire Venomous Tentacula on a bet, and, though he survived, his skin was left purple.[3][4]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Early life 1.2 As a comedian 1.3 Recognition   2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography Early life Shimpling was born in the year 1912.[3][4]  As a comedian Shimpling became a famed comedian, very popular for his daring sense of humour.[2] Shimpling was also famous for making bets lightly. Once, he ate an entire Venomous Tentacula on a bet, and, though he survived, his skin was left permanently purple.[3][4]  Recognition    Shimpling's portrait   He was also featured on a silver Chocolate Frog Card as part of the Famous Witches and Wizards Cards series, for his famous achievement. During the 1993–1994 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a portrait of him guarded a secret room, the password to enter was "Tummy-button".[5]  Etymology Derwent means "valley thick with oaks". It was a village in Derbyshire that was drowned by the creation of the Ladybower Reservoir. Oaks usually symbolise strength and endurance, like how Derwent had to endure eating a Venomous Tentacula. Shimpling is a village and civil parish in south Suffolk, England. Located around seven miles from Bury St Edmunds, it is a part of the Baghbert district.
