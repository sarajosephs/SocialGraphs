He was the father of Chadwick and Webster Boot, two founders of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[1]  Biography Mr Boot and his wife were originally from Ireland. In the 1620s, they decided to move to the New World with their young sons, Chadwick and Webster, in search of an adventure. They travelled with the Plymouth settlement, and became friends with a Muggle stonemason, James Steward, on their journey across the Atlantic.[1] However, when the family left the settlement to venture into the nearby woods for their adventure, they were attacked by a Hidebehind. Mr Boot and his wife were killed, but Isolt Sayre and William the Pukwudgie intervened, and managed to save their sons' lives. The boys were subsequently nursed back to health by Isolt.[1] Two weeks later, Isolt returned to the place the Mr and Mrs Boot were killed, intending to give the couple a decent burial. She found that James Steward was already in the process of digging graves himself. James had become concerned when his friends went missing, and thus went looking for them in the woods.[1] Mr Boot's sons were adopted by Isolt and James. Isolt took Mr Boot's wand (which had a dragon heartstring core), along with that of his wife. However, both wands were broken and their cores eventually died, meaning they could not be passed on to the couple's sons. Nonetheless, Isolt was able to study the couple's wands, and this helped her to craft new wands for her adopted sons.[1] Mr Boot's sons would go on to help found Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Through his son Chadwick, he become an ancestor of Calderon-Boot family, and through his son Webster, an ancestor of later British Boots (including Terry Boot).[1]  Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.12 1.13 1.14 1.15 1.16 1.17 1.18 Writing by J.
