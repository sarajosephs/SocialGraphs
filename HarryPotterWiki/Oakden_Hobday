Contents  1 Behind the scenes 2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Behind the scenes Professor Hobday was one of two names which J. K. Rowling considered giving to the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in Harry Potter's fifth year when she was planning Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.[1] Etymology The name "Oakden" began as a surname and was derived from Ogden, the name of several places in England, which means "oak valley", from the Old English words ac, "oak", and denu, "valley".[2]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Early drafts (planned only)) J.
