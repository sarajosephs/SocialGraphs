He has a twin brother, Lorcan.[5]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography When his mother travelled to the Patagonian Desert, in Argentina, to attend the final of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, in July 2014, Lysander was left at home with his grandfather, along with Lorcan.[2]  Etymology Lysander means "liberator of mankind" or simply "liberator" in Greek. Lysander is the name of a principal character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. The play takes place largely at night, "lit by moonlight" as Oberon states, which hearkens back to Lysander's mother, Luna. Behind the scenes He may have identified as Jewish, as his great-grandmother was Porpentina Goldstein. Appearances J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life (Mentioned only) Pottermore (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life confirms that Luna had children "considerably later" than Harry and his friends; Harry's last child was born in 2008 as was Ron and Hermione's. While the exact date cannot be established as "considerable" has too many variables, we know it was after 2008.  ↑ 2.0 2.1  Pottermore - DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP_FINAL (Archived)  ↑ Lysander's mother, Luna is a witch, and his father Rolf is a magizoologist, so Lysander is not muggle or muggle-born.  ↑ Harry Potter: Wizards Unite  ↑ J.K.
