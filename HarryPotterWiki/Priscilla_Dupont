She was elected Minister likely only once.[1]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography Dupont was elected as the Minister for Magic of Great Britain in 1855. Upon her accession to the office, she developed an irrational loathing of the Muggle Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston. This attained such proportions that it ended up in her being forced to step down on 17 February, 1858, after such incidents as coins turning to frogspawn in Lord Palmerston's coat pockets. Ironically, Palmerston was forced to resign by the Muggles two days later on 19 February.[1]  Magical abilities and skills Transfiguration: Dupont possessed a degree of proficiency in this branch of magic, as she was capable of turning coins into frogspawn in the pockets of Lord Palmerston successfully.[1] Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 Writing by J.
