They like punishment, the Carrows." — Neville Lingbottom regarding the cruelty of Alecto and Amycus Carrow[src]  Carrow was the surname of a pure-blood[1] wizarding family, and one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Bent on the Dark Arts, the family is infamous for having produced three notable Dark Wizards and Witches, most notably the siblings Amycus and Alecto Carrow, who were part of the ranks of the Death Eaters during the First and Second Wizarding Wars.  Contents  1 History 2 Family members 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   History in the 20s and 30s, a witch from this family known as Carrow served as an acolyte of Gellert Grindelwald.[3] Alecto once viciously slashed the face of Neville Longbottom when he asked her how much Muggle blood she had, outraged by the anti-Muggle propaganda she taught as professor of Muggle Studies during the 1997–1998 school year, when Lord Voldemort was in control of the Ministry of Magic. They would punish the students by using the Cruciatus Curse on people in detention.[4] Flora and Hestia Carrow, twin Slytherin students, were part of the Slug Club during the 1996–1997 school year.

Alecto Carrow  Death Eater and professor of Muggle Studies during the 1997–1998 school year.   Amycus Carrow  Death Eater and professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts (effectively the Dark Arts) during the 1997–1998 school year.   Flora Carrow  Students at Hogwarts in the 1990s and members of the Slug Club.[5]   Hestia Carrow  Etymology In English, the word; "Carrow", can refer to two places. "Carrow" in Norfolk, or "Carraw" in Northumberland. The first is assumed to have its name derived from the Old English word "carr", meaning "rock", and a word of Celtic origin; "hoh", meaning "spur of a hill". While the second appears to have been named either after the plural of the Old English word "carr", or after a mixture of a form of "carr", and another Old English word; "raw", meaning "row". It is also possible that the surname was originally a shortened version of the Cornish surname; "Nancarrow".
