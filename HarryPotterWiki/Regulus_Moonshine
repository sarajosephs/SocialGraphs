This article is about the potioneer. You may be looking for Regulus Black, the former Death Eater.   Regulus Moonshine   Biographical information  Born Prior to 1982[1]   Title(s) Professor[2]    Physical information  Species Human[2]   Gender Male[2]    Affiliation  Occupation Potioneer[2]Inventor[2]   [Source]  Professor Regulus Moonshine was a wizard who developed a potion to suppress hags' normal appetite for human flesh. He lost several chunks of own body while conducting the clinical trials.[2] An article in the Daily Prophet called him "Professor",[2] but it is not known if he ever taught at a wizarding school, like Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Contents  1 Magical abilities and skills 2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Magical abilities and skills Potions: Moonshine was evidently a talented potioneer, given how he successfully developed a potion to suppress the human flesh-eating tendencies of hags.[2] Etymology The name "Regulus" is a Roman cognomen which meant "rule" in Latin. This was the name of several early saints. Moonshine, also known as white lightning, mountain dew, hooch or Tennessee white whiskey, is a high-proof distilled spirit, generally produced illicitly.  Appearances Daily Prophet Newsletters (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ As Moonshine has a career and was called "Professor", he is clearly over-age and due to his title it can be assumed that he is older than seventeen.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 Daily Prophet Newsletters 1 October, 1999, Page 1     Potions (class)      Potioneers   Arsenius Jigger · Bilius Finbok · Blossom Degrasse · Dai Ryusaki · Damocles Belby · Erica Stainwright · Fleamont Potter · Gethsemane Prickle · Gilderoy Lockhart · Glossy · Glover Hipworth · Golpalott · Gregory the Smarmy · Gunhilda de Gorsemoor · Hector Dagworth-Granger · Hesper Starkey · J.
