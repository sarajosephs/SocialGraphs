She was in the same year as Harry Potter and was Sorted into Ravenclaw House.[3]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes  2.1 Translations   3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology Mandy is a variation of Amanda, which means "lovable/worth of love". Brocklehurst is a real surname coming from Middle English "brock" (badger) and "hyrst" (wooded hill, a favourite haunt of badgers). Brocklehurst was the name of the horrible school teacher in Jane Eyre. Behind the scenes The character Amanda, portrayed by Christina Petrou in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, may be intended to be Mandy Brocklehurst. One of the clients of Cormoran Strike, a private detective and the protagonist of J. K. Rowling's The Silkworm, has hired him to monitor the activities of a Miss Brocklehurst.
