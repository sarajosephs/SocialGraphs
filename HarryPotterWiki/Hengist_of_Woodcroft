Hengist of Woodcroft   Biographical information  Born 982 or later[1]Woodcroft, Gloucestershire   Nationality English    Physical information  Species Human   Gender Male   Hair colour Red   Skin colour White    Affiliation  Occupation Founder of Hogsmeade   House Hufflepuff[2]   Loyalty HogsmeadeHogwarts School of Witchcraft and WizardryHufflepuff   [Source]  Hengist of Woodcroft was a Medieval English wizard, best known as the founder of the village of Hogsmeade in Scotland, the only all-wizarding village in Great Britain.  Contents  1 Biography 2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Hengist was born in the Middle Ages, circa 987,[1] in Woodcroft, Gloucestershire. In his youth, Hengist attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was Sorted into Hufflepuff.[2] He may have been taught by Helga Hufflepuff herself.     Hengist founding Hogsmeade   Hengist was traditionally credited with the founding of the village of Hogsmeade after being driven from his home by Muggle persecutors. According to popular lore, Hengist used the Three Broomsticks Inn as a home.[3] Hengist died at some point during the Middle Ages. Remembered for his founding of Hogsmeade, he was immortalised in a Chocolate Frog Card[3] Hengist of Woodcroft's Chocolate Frog Card was one of the very first collected by Harry Potter.[4] There was also a bust of Hengist on the fourth-floor corridor of the Hogwarts Castle.[5] On 1 September, 1991, Prefect Gabriel Truman welcomed Hufflepuff first-year students to the Hufflepuff Basement with a short speech in which he mentioned Hengist of Woodcroft as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been sorted, like them, into Hufflepuff.[2]  Etymology The name "Hengist" means "stallion" in Germanic. Hengist and his brother Horsa were the leaders of the first Germanic settlers in Britain. Hengist established a kingdom in Kent in the 5th century.  Behind the scenes Hogwarts Legacy shows the foundation of Hogsmeade in 914, suggesting that Hengist was alive by that time.[6] This is anachronistic, however, as Hogwarts did not exist until 990, which Hengist was known to attend.
