Etymology The name "Harold" comes from the Old English name Hereweald meaning "leader of the army", derived from the elements here "army" and weald "leader, ruler". The Old Norse cognate Haraldr was also common among Scandinavian settlers in England. 'To skive' is an English verb that means 'to avoid one's assigned work or duty', or 'to slack off'.
