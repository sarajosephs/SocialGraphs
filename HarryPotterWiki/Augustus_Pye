Presumably, Nagini's venom made Arthur's wounds impossible to heal in this manner.[2] During the Calamity, Pye taught trainee Magizoologists how to master the Stamina Charm, to help them restore stamina to themselves in combat.[3]  Etymology The name "Augustus" means "great" or "venerable", derived from Latin augere "to increase". Augustus was the title given to Octavian, the first Roman emperor. He was the adopted son of Julius Caesar who rose to power through a combination of military skill and political prowess. This was also the name of three kings of Poland.
