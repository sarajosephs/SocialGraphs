I like a healthy breeze around my privates, thanks." — Archie to a Ministry of Magic official at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup[src]  Archie Aymslowe was a wizard and president of the Fresh Air Refreshes Totally (F.A.R.T.) movement, a fringe group whose members, in direct violation of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, refuse to wear Muggle trousers in public, insisting that they "stem the magical flow at source."[2]  Biography Archie attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup. Since the event was a large gathering of wizards, the Ministry of Magic wanted them to dress as Muggles. Archie himself wore a flowery female nightdress without realising that what he had chosen was inappropriate.  However, he resisted all efforts by a Ministry official to get him to change into a pair of pin-striped trousers, insisting that he preferred a "healthy breeze" around his "privates." Hermione Granger found this amusing, having a fit of giggles and having to duck out of the area, waiting until Archie had left to return to the others.[1]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance) Pottermore Wizarding World Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 7 (Bagman and Crouch)  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 Writing by J.
