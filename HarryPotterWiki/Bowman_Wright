Bowman Wright   Biographical information  Born 1492   Died 1560 (aged 67-68)   Blood status Half-blood[1]   Nationality British    Physical information  Species Human   Gender Male   Hair colour Black   Eye colour Blue   Skin colour White    Relationship information  Family members Mr Wright (father)Mrs Wright (mother)    Affiliation  Occupation Metal charmer   Loyalty Quidditch   [Source]  Bowman Wright (1492-1560) was a half-blood wizard and a skilled metal charmer who lived in Godric's Hollow sometime during the Middle Ages.[2][3][4][5]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 Behind the scenes 5 Appearances 6 Notes and references   Biography Born to a witch mother and a Muggle father, he invented the Golden Snitch as a replacement for the endangered Golden Snidget, combining his interest in science, magic, and sports.[2][3][4][5] Bowman Wright was buried in Godric's Hollow. His grave is one of the oldest graves in St Jerome's graveyard.[6]  Magical abilities and skills Charms: Being a professional Metal charmer, Bowman was highly gifted and skilful with charm-work, as he was the inventor of the famous Golden Snitch, a magical flying object used in Quidditch, casting the necessary charms needed to both craft and enchant the Snitch, which continued to last long after his death, showing his superb proficiency in this field of magic. Etymology The English "wright" is a word referring to a skilled craftsman.  Behind the scenes The dates given for Bowman's birth and death on his Famous Wizard Card (1492-1560) do not agree with the timeframe laid down in Quidditch Through the Ages, which would indicate that he was alive towards the end of the 1300s. Bowman shares the same last name as Bonnie Wright, who portrays Ginny Weasley in the Harry Potter films. Incidentally, Bonnie Wright's parents, Gary Wright and Sheila Teague, are both jewellers.
