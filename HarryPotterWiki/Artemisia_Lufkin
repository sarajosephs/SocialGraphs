A Hufflepuff student in her early years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Lufkin became the first woman ever to hold the office and was elected at least twice, serving from 1798 to 1811.

In her youth, she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from around 1765 to 1772, where she was sorted into Hufflepuff.[4]  As Minister for Magic In 1798, Ms. Lufkin rose to the position of Minister for Magic of Great Britain, and Ireland, succeeding Unctuous Osbert, and became the first woman ever to have held the office.[3] As Minister for Magic, she established the Department of International Magical Co-operation and lobbied hard and successfully to have a Quidditch World Cup tournament held in Britain during her term.[5] She served as Minister for thirteen years, being succeeded in the post by Grogan Stump in 1811.  Death and post-mortem    Artemisia Lufkin's silver Chocolate Frog Card   Ms. Lufkin passed away in 1825, aged around 71. She was featured in a Chocolate Frog Card by the 1990s.[3] On 1 September, 1991, Prefect Gabriel Truman welcomed the Hufflepuff first years to Hufflepuff Basement with a short speech in which he mentioned former Minister Artemisia Lufkin as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been Sorted, like them, into Hufflepuff.[4]  Etymology Artemisia is a feminine form of Artemisios,[6] a Greek name which derived from Artemis,[7] the name of the Greek maiden daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She is the goddess of the moon, hunting, the wilderness, and the gift of taming wild animals.[8] Artemisia is also the name of a genus of plants that includes sagebrush and wormwood.[9] Artemisia Gentileschi was a pioneering Italian painter of the Baroque movement, the first woman to join the Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze, as well as one of the first to handle religious and historical subjects.[10] Lufkin is a pet form of the Middle English given name Love,[11] which derived from either the Old English girl's name Lufu, meaning "love", or its masculine equivalent Lufa.[12] The meaning of her surname is rather curious and ironic, considering "Lufa-Lufa" is the Portuguese name for Hufflepuff, the house she was sorted in, and the suffix 'kin' is often used to refer to a person's children. In other words, her surname can be rather fittingly interpreted as "child of Hufflepuff". Behind the scenes Artemisia as depicted on her Chocolate Frog Card has an uncanny resemblance to Lady Tremaine as depicted in the Walt Disney animated film Cinderella released in 1950.
