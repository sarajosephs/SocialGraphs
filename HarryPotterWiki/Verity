Physical appearance Verity was young and had short blonde hair.[3]  Behind the scenes Verity is seen very briefly during the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, she is seen moving boxes with joke products upstairs and later she is working on the shop's till dealing with customers. In the film adaptation she has long brown hair instead of short blonde like she does in the books. In the film adaptation she looks very much like a teenager. It is unknown who portrayed her in the film adaptation. In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 she has white hair and white clothes. She is seen on the staircase trapped by Fanged Frisbees, possibly Fanged Flyers. Verity is given the love potion by Harry Potter in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7. Etymology The name Verity could be derived from the French word Vérité, which means truth. Both derive from Latin Veritas, also meaning truth.[4] Appearances Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (First appearance) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 Notes and references   ↑ She must be at least 17 to work in 1996.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 6 (Draco's Detour)  ↑ 3.0 3.1 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 6 (Draco's Detour) - "A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain;"  ↑ Dictionnaire Larousse 2001    London's wizarding quarter   England, Great Britain   Carkitt Market - Diagon Alley - Horizont Alley - Knockturn Alley    Diagon Alley   Shops    2nd Hand Brooms ·  Amanuensis Quills ·  Broomstix ·  Broom Brakes Service ·  Broom Shop ·  Cauldron Workshop ·  Cranville Quincey's Magical Junkshop ·  Fine Enchanting Cauldrons ·  Floo-Pow ·  Florist's stall ·  Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop ·  J.
