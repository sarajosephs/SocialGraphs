The content of this article is derived from notes and drafts of the Harry Potter books/films/games that were cut before being released.  As such, the contents of the article may or may not be considered canonical.  "Point me!"  This article is about the Hogwarts student. You may be looking for the Ministry of Magic employee, Albert Runcorn.   Runcorn   Biographical information  Born Between 1 September 1979 and 31 August 1980   Blood status Pure-blood, Half-blood or Muggle-born   Nationality British or Irish[1]    Physical information  Species Human   Gender Female[2]    Relationship information  Family members Albert Runcorn (possible relative)Runcorn family    Affiliation  House Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin[3]   Loyalty Runcorn familyHogwarts School of Witchcraft and WizardryGryffindor, Hufflepuff or Slytherin   [Source]  Runcorn (c. 1979-1980) was a witch[2] who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991. She was in the same year as Harry Potter and was sorted into either Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin house.[3]  Behind the scenes Only Runcorn's surname is visible on the small portion of the second page of J. K. Rowling's student list shown on Harry Potter and Me. Although her name is visible on J. K. Rowling's student list, Runcorn is not featured on the "Original Forty" list on  Pottermore. As said list actually only features thirty-nine characters, Runcorn was presumably left out by mistake. She could possibly have been a relative of Albert Runcorn, a Ministry worker whom Harry Potter once impersonated through the means of Polyjuice Potion. Appearances Harry Potter and Me (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 2.0 2.1 Runcorn is the only student seen on the Harry Potter and Me list not to be included in "The Original Forty" on  Pottermore, presumably due to an error in transcription. The latter list is missing one female.  ↑ 3.0 3.1 J. K. Rowling's original list of forty students contains five males and five females from each house. As all five Ravenclaw females are known, the remaining females whose houses are unknown must be in one of the other three houses.
