She was elected at least twice.[2] She revealed an unhealthy anti-Muggle bias in office and disliked new Muggle technology such as the telegraph, which she claimed interfered with proper wand function.[2]  Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Writing by J. K. Rowling: "Pure-Blood" at Wizarding World - The Flints are mentioned to have been included in the Pure-Blood Directory published in Britain in the 1930s. As Josephina was already alive by 1930, this establishes that she must not be a Muggle or Muggle-born.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 Writing by J. K.
