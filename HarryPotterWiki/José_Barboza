The Welsh manager was dragged from the pitch by her own Beaters, and was later put in custody. The Daily Prophet later reported that Healers confirmed Barboza's skin had almost regrown, and that he was in excellent spirits.[3]  Appearances Pottermore (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2  Pottermore - Quidditch World Cup 1990 - 2014 (Archived)  ↑ 2.0 2.1  Pottermore - PLACE YOUR BETS WITH LUDO BAGMAN (Archived)  ↑ 3.0 3.1  Pottermore - BRAZIL_VERSUS_WALES (Archived)              Categories         Categories:   Brazilian individuals    Males    Quidditch managers    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский 中文      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
