Contents  1 Biography 2 Personality and traits 3 Magical abilities and skills 4 Possessions 5 Etymology 6 Behind the scenes 7 Appearances 8 Notes and references   Biography Kirley was the son of Quidditch player Catriona McCormack and the brother of Meaghan McCormack. Both women played for the Pride of Portree.[5] Kirley attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[7] from 1983 to 1989.[2] He later joined the Weird Sisters, and was one of its first three members.[7]  Personality and traits Kirley appeared to be a man of few words.[8]  Magical abilities and skills Charms: Kirley was capable of producing a non-corporeal Patronus,[6] which is a highly impressive magical achievement, given the difficulty of casting the charm. Possessions Guitar: Kirley owned a guitar, which was confiscated by Argus Filch in the 1989–1990 school year, which was retrieved by Jacob's sibling and returned to him.[8] He used this guitar to play at numerous events, such as the concert at the Great Lake,[8] the party at the Three Broomsticks Inn[9] and the Yule Ball.[10] Etymology A "Duke" is a nobleman with the highest hereditary rank, especially a man of the highest grade of the peerage in Great Britain.  Behind the scenes Kirley Duke was portrayed by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Kirley's appearance as depicted in the video games differs. In his Famous Wizard Card appearance from the first two video games, he is depicted as blond, but in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, he is depicted as dark-haired (which is based on his depiction in the fourth film).
