This article is about Nagnok. You may be looking for Ragnok.         Nagnok   Biographical information  Died Before 1801    Physical information  Species Goblin   Gender Male    Affiliation  Occupation Gringotts employee   Loyalty Gringotts Wizarding Bank   [Source]  Nagnok was a Gringotts goblin who was accidentally killed by an untrained Security Troll sent by the Ministry of Magic, sometime in or before the 18th century.[1] His accidental death was a catalyst to one of many Goblin Rebellions in the 17th and 18th centuries.[2]  Behind the scenes InThe Wizarding World of Harry Potter, one can see an office at Gringotts Wizarding Bank bearing Nagnok's name on the door.[3] While it is true that Nagnok worked at Gringotts, it is unusual that his office still bears his name, around at least 200 years after his death. Though this may be a different Goblin with the same first name. Appearances J. K. Rowling's official site (First mentioned) Harry Potter: Wizards Unite (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ Third Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test from J. K. Rowling's official site.  ↑ This piece of information comes from the third W.O.M.B.A.T. featured in J. K. Rowling's official site. Question 2 (Part One - Magical History) is "Which of the following did NOT provoke one of the bloody goblin rebellions of the 17th and 18th centuries? Choose ONE.", and one of the possible answers is "The accidental death of Nagnok, Gringotts Goblin, at the hands of an untrained security troll sent by the Ministry of Magic". As one of the other answers is known for certain to be false ("The imprisonment of the notoriously violent Hodrod the Horny-Handed, who had attempted to kill three wizards " — the Daily Prophet Newsletters reveal that Hodrod the Horny-Handed was indeed imprisoned for attempting to kill three wizards, but this happened in 1999, during the Chipping Clodbury riot), then all of the other answers must be true, including the one about Nagnok.  ↑ The DIS - "Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts Queue and Dragon" on Youtube              Categories         Categories:   Accidental deaths    Bankers    British individuals    Deaths by creature    Goblins    Gringotts employees    Historical figures    Males             Languages      Deutsch Español Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
