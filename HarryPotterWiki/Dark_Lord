Lord Voldemort, who addressed himself as "Dark Lord"   "Dark Lord" was a title to address Voldemort during both of his failed attempts to conquer wizarding Britain. Tom Riddle was a Dark Wizard who adopted the name Lord Voldemort before the First Wizarding War.[1] The title of Dark Lord was used mainly by Death Eaters,[2][3] something which Severus Snape was called out for by Harry Potter.[4] Calling Voldemort “the Dark Lord” was seen as a mark of utmost respect among the Death Eaters, while calling him by his real name was akin to blasphemy to rabid followers like Bellatrix Lestrange.[5]  Contents  1 Behind the scenes 2 Appearances 3 See also 4 Notes and references   Behind the scenes Curiously, when Snape calls Voldemort "the Dark Lord," Harry makes an accusatory statement, claiming to have only heard the Death Eaters call him that. However, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Garrick Ollivander, who has never been suspected of being a Death Eater, called him that as he talked about his past achievements. Later, in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Ginny Weasley wrote a poem that referred to Voldemort as "the Dark Lord." Later still, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Professor Sybill Trelawney, who has never been suspected of being a Death Eater, called him "the Dark Lord". However, Trelawney's use of the title "the Dark Lord" was used largely for poetic effect rather than out of loyalty. It is possible that Harry forgot these examples due to his anger at Snape, or selectively ignored them in favour of accusing Snape of being a Death Eater.
