Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology    Image of Ursula's son Phineas Black on the family tree   The name Ursula means "little bear", derived from the Latin word ursa, "she-bear", which gives its name to two constellations associated with the Greek myth of Callisto, a nymph who was turned into a bear. Saint Ursula was a legendary Roman-British princess who was martyred by the Huns while returning from a pilgrimage in the fourth century.[4]  Behind the scenes Ursula Flint may be related to Marcus Flint, captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team during the early years of the 1990s. Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Appears on Black family tapestry) Notes and references   ↑ Cygnus Black II was born that year.  ↑ They share the same surname; unlike family connections in the Muggle world, where people with the same surnames may be unrelated to one another, families in the Wizarding world who share the same surname are more than likely part of the same family line.  ↑ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)  ↑ Behind the Name: Ursula              Categories         Categories:   19th century deaths    British individuals    Females    Flint family    House of Black    Married individuals    Parents    Pure-bloods    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
