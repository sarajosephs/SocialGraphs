Incidentally, that thing you are dreading -- it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October." — Sybill Trelawney's prediction to Lavender Brown[src]  Binky (d. 15 October, 1993)[2] was the pet rabbit of Lavender Brown, and by extension of the Brown family. He died on the 15 October, 1993 at a fairly young age.[3]  Biography  Parvati Patil: "She got a letter from home this morning. It's her rabbit, Binky. He's been killed by a fox." Hermione Granger: "Oh, I'm sorry, Lavender." — Hermione comforting Lavender over the deceased Binky[src]  Binky eventually became the pet of Lavender Brown.[3] On 16 October, 1993, Lavender received the news that Binky had been killed by a fox, which greatly upset Lavender though she was convinced that her Divination professor Sybill Trelawney had predicted this event accurately. However, Hermione Granger was quick to point out the flaws in the logic that this was the event Trelawney had predicted, since the rabbit was young and healthy, giving Lavender no cause for fear, and the death itself did not occur on the 16th, only the report thereof.[3]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (First mentioned) Pottermore (First appearance) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Given that Lavender described it as "a baby."  ↑ 2.0 2.1 Writing by J.
