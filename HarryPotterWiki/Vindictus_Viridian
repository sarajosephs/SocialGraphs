Please pester someone else!" — Viridian's portrait, refusing to open to Harry Potter[src]  Professor Vindictus Viridian was a wizard who was a potioneer, author and Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early eighteenth century.  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Lifetime 1.2 Post-mortem   2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 Behind the scenes 5 Appearances 6 Notes and references   Biography Lifetime Based on his portrait, Viridian was a potioneer. At some point in his life, he was named Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[4] Also during his lifetime, he published a famous book on dark charms: Curses and Counter-Curses (Bewitch your Friends and Befuddle your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and much, much more).[3] He also published the book How to Tame Tigers.[5]  Post-mortem    Professor Viridian's portrait in the Headmaster's office   Professor Viridian died sometime in or prior to 1994.[1] Two portraits of him hung at Hogwarts: one was painted in 1703[6] and hung in the Headmaster's office along with the portraits of other Headmasters and Headmistresses,[4] and the other hung in the Grand Staircase.[7] In the 1995-1996 school year, Viridian's portrait at the Grand Staircase was used to conceal the entrance to the Room of Rewards. He was frequently annoyed by all the hustle and bustle of the students' school life. In order to gain entry to the Room of Rewards, Hermione Granger threatened to convince Myrtle Warren to haunt the landing where the portrait hung. Disliking Myrtle, Viridian let Harry Potter and his friends through.[7]  Magical abilities and skills    Portrait of an older Vindictus Viridian   Dark Arts: Professor Viridian was highly proficient with curses, hexes and jinxes, and wrote a book which included such dark charms as the: Full Body-Bind Curse, Jelly-Legs Curse, Leg-Locker Curse, Pimple Jinx, Stickfast Hex, Tickling Hex, Tongue-Tying Curse and Hair Loss Curse.[3] Potions: Professor Viridian was a highly accomplished and skilful Potioneer, as evidenced by several portraits of him brewing various potions. Etymology The name Vindictus is derived from the Latin vindicta ("revenge") and the surname Viridian from the Latin viridis ("green").  Behind the scenes Harry Potter Limited Edition confirms that his surname was misspelled "Veridian" in the film series. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 5 images related to Vindictus Viridian.

K. Rowling stated at the Edinburgh Book Festival on 15 August 2004 (source) that all portraits at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are of deceased individuals. Thus, Viridian must have died sometime in or before 1994, given his portrait's appearance at Hogwarts in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 5 (Diagon Alley)  ↑ 4.0 4.1 The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - see this image  ↑ Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) (see this image)  ↑ See this image.  ↑ 7.0 7.1 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)  ↑ DVD 2 - Special Features (The Quest of Sir Cadogan)        Preceded by:Unknown, eventually Everard  Headmaster of HogwartsBefore 1703  Succeeded by:Unknown, eventually Dilys Derwent         Hogwarts faculty   Founders  Godric Gryffindor | Helga Hufflepuff | Rowena Ravenclaw | Salazar Slytherin   Headteachers  Giffard Abbott | Walter Aragon | Bearded man holding a book | Phineas Nigellus Black | Elizabeth Burke | Antonia Creaseworthy | Dilys Derwent | Armando Dippet | Albus Dumbledore | Mordicus Egg | Everard | First headmaster | Dexter Fortescue | Basil Fronsac | Brian Gagwilde | Limebert | Minerva McGonagall | Eupraxia Mole | Pink-faced headmaster | Resting headmaster | Edessa Sakndenberg | Brutus Scrimgeour | Phyllida Spore | Severus Snape | Amrose Swott | Quentin Trimble | Dolores Umbridge | Fytherley Undercliffe | Vindictus Viridian | Vulpus | Heliotrope Wilkins | Gimlet-eyed headmistress | Headmaster (1568) | Headteacher (1792) | Headmaster in blue | Headmaster with book | Headmaster in gold | Headmaster with apple | Headmaster with astrolabe | Headmaster with castle sketch | Headmaster with paper | Headmaster with rings | Headmaster with scroll | Headmaster with sphere | Headmaster with starmap | Headmaster with wand   Deputy Heads  Minerva McGonagall | Amycus Carrow | Alecto Carrow   Heads of House  Muldoon Cragg | Filius Flitwick | Godric Gryffindor | Gryffindor lady | Gryffindor man (II) | Gryffindor man (III) | Gryffindor man (IV) | Gryffindor Seeker | Helga Hufflepuff | Neville Longbottom | Minerva McGonagall  | Valeria Myriadd | Uric Oapley | Podric Piles | Prendergast | Rowena Ravenclaw | Horace Slughorn | Salazar Slytherin | Severus Snape | Pomona Sprout | Tobias Stump   Teaching staff  Bartholomew | Bathsheda Babbling | Herbert Beery | Cuthbert Binns | Brindlemore | Charity Burbage | Camelia | Alecto Carrow | Amycus Carrow | Bartemius Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody) | Clodagh Dromgoole | Albus Dumbledore | Eleazar Fig | Firenze | Filius Flitwick | Fortinbras | Jakub Gorski | Olivia Green | Rubeus Hagrid | Hecat | Rolanda Hooch | Ernesto Jags | Arsenius Jigger | Igor Karkaroff's Yule Ball partner | Silvanus Kettleburn | Gilderoy Lockhart | Neville Longbottom | Remus Lupin | Elspeth MacGillony | Mazoni | Minerva McGonagall | Galatea Merrythought | Natsai Onai's mother | Prendergast | Quirinus Quirrell | Patricia Rakepick | Abraham Ronen | Concordia Rowle | Arif Sikander | Aurora Sinistra | Horace Slughorn | Severus Snape | Pomona Sprout | Swoopstikes | Sybill Trelawney | Trocar | Dolores Umbridge | Septima Vector | Unidentified professor | Potions professor (16th century) | Flying Instructor (19th century) | Herbology professor (19th century) | Potions professor (19th century) | DADA professor (1984–1985) | DADA professor (1985–1986) | DADA professor (1986–1987) | DADA professor (1987–1988) | DADA professor (1989–1990) | DADA professor (1990–1991) | Muggle Studies professor (1990s) | DADA professor (1998–?) | Potions professor (21st century) | Charms professor (?th century)   Hogwarts house-elves  Bilm | Boil-ridden house-elf | Deek | Dobby | Filk | Gimkey | Krafty | Kreacher | Pitts | Retch | Vekey | Wigby | Winky | Unidentified house-elf   Support staff  Rancorous Carpe | Argus Filch | Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank | Rubeus Hagrid | Rolanda Hooch | Hankerton Humble | Ogg | Irma Pince | Poppy Pomfrey | Apollyon Pringle | Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus | Wainscott | Unidentified Healers | Unidentified female nurse | Unidentified librarian | Unidentified male nurse    Potions (class)      Potioneers   Arsenius Jigger · Bilius Finbok · Blossom Degrasse · Dai Ryusaki · Damocles Belby · Erica Stainwright · Fleamont Potter · Gethsemane Prickle · Gilderoy Lockhart · Glossy · Glover Hipworth · Golpalott · Gregory the Smarmy · Gunhilda de Gorsemoor · Hector Dagworth-Granger · Hesper Starkey · J.
