During his lifetime, he took possession of and won the mastery of the Elder Wand, which, in the wrong hands, was a weapon of immense power. Predisposed towards violence and fuelled by a great thirst of power,[4] he used it to terrorise southern England in the early Middle Ages. He was "slaughtered" in a ferocious duel against Egbert the Egregious.[1] Apparently, his death was gruesome.[5] During their History of Magic lessons with Professor Binns at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, first-year students often mixed up Emeric the Evil with Uric the Oddball.[3] The seventh-year History of Magic curriculum also covered Emeric the Evil, at least in the 1990–1991 school year.[5] Corey Hayden also spoke to several fellow students in the History of Magic Classroom about Emeric the Evil at the start of the same school year.[6]  Magical abilities and skills Dark Arts: Emeric the Evil was a prolific Dark Wizard who terrorised Southern England in the early Middle Ages, which he likely did using the Dark Arts.[1] Duelling: Having gained ownership of the legendary Elder Wand, Emeric was an aggressive wizard with a proclivity for duelling and martial magic; however, he was defeated and killed in a duel with Egbert the Egregious, meaning he was an inferior duellist to him.[1] Care of Magical Creatures: Emeric was capable of flying a dragon-like creature, a dangerous looking magical beast.[7] Etymology The name "Emeric" is a Germanic name, in which the second element is ric meaning "power". The first element may be ermen "whole, universal" (making it a relative of Ermenrich), amal "work, labour" (making it a relative of Amalric) or heim "home" (making it a relative of Henry). It is likely that several forms merged into a single name.  Behind the scenes In The Tales of Beedle the Bard: Illustrated Edition, Chris Riddell depicts Emeric the Evil riding an unnamed dragon-like creature, which is unnamed in the text, it is only shown in the illustration of him. This is not stated in the original version of The Tales of Beedle the Bard either. The nature of this dragon is also unknown. It is also possibly a Wyvern, but that is also unknown.
