[Source]    "All the fifth years were suffering from stress to some degree, but Hannah Abbott became the first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now." — Hannah's easily flustered personality[src]  Hannah Abbott (b. 1979/1980)[1] was a half-blood[2] witch and a member of the Abbott family. In September 1991, she started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Hufflepuff House.[7] Hannah was in the same year as the famous Harry Potter.[7] In her fifth year, she became both a prefect and a member of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. In 1996, Hannah was pulled out of school after her mother was murdered by Death Eaters, but she returned the following year and was once again a member of the D.A. She fought in the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May, 1998. Later in life, Hannah married fellow classmate Neville Longbottom and became landlady of the Leaky Cauldron, which the couple lived above. She eventually trained as a healer and applied for the job of Matron at Hogwarts.[3]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Early life 1.2 Hogwarts years (1991-1998)  1.2.1 First year 1.2.2 Second year 1.2.3 Third year 1.2.4 Fourth year 1.2.5 Fifth year 1.2.6 Sixth year 1.2.7 Seventh year  1.2.7.1 Battle of Hogwarts     1.3 Later life (1998-2014)   2 Physical description 3 Personality and traits 4 Magical abilities and skills 5 Possessions 6 Relationships  6.1 Neville Longbottom 6.2 Ernie Macmillan 6.3 Justin Finch-Fletchley 6.4 Susan Bones   7 Etymology 8 Behind the scenes 9 Appearances 10 Notes and references   Biography Early life Hannah was born in Great Britain or Ireland in 1979 or 1980.[1] She was a member of the pure-blood wizarding Abbott family that was one of the so-called Sacred Twenty-Eight,[12] though she herself was a half-blood,[2] indicating she also had some Muggle heritage.  Hogwarts years (1991-1998) First year  Minerva McGonagall: "When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted. Abbott, Hannah!" Sorting Hat: "HUFFLEPUFF!" — Hannah Abbott being Sorted into Hufflepuff[src]     Hannah's sorting on 1 September, 1991   Hannah began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on 1 September, 1991, along with Harry Potter.[7] Since Hannah's surname, Abbott, was the first alphabetically, she was the first new student in her year to be sorted into her house during the Welcoming Feast. She was Sorted into Hufflepuff House, along with other new students Ernie Macmillan, Susan Bones, and Justin Finch-Fletchley.[7] She shared a dormitory with her fellow Hufflepuff classmates; Megan Jones, Susan Bones, and others.  Second year  Hannah: "You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?" Ernie Macmillan: "Hannah, he's a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that's the mark of a Dark Wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue" Hannah: "He always seems so nice, though, and, well, he's the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can't be all bad, can he?" — Hannah, Ernie and several Hufflepuff students discussing Harry Potter[src]     Hannah and Ernie studying with other Hufflepuffs   In 1992, Hannah's second year, when the Chamber of Secrets had been reopened, Hannah was one of the many students who believed that Harry Potter was the Heir of Slytherin after it became known that he was a Parselmouth. She was initially sceptical, saying that Harry 'always seemed so nice', but was eventually convinced by her friend Ernie Macmillan that Harry was the one that had attacked Muggle-born students around Hogwarts, including her housemate and friend Justin Finch-Fletchley, which didn't go down well with Hannah, unsettling her.[13]      Hannah during a second year Transfiguration lesson   When Hermione was attacked by the Basilisk, Ernie and Hannah apologised, knowing Harry would never harm her. Ernie asked Harry if he believed that Draco Malfoy was the Heir of Slytherin, to which Harry replied with a quick no, causing both Ernie and Hannah to stare.[14] It was later revealed that Malfoy was not the culprit after Harry defeated Tom Riddle, destroying his diary horcrux and Slytherin's basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets. Hannah was present at the End-of-Term Feast, after all the students who were petrified were returned to their normal state.[15]  Third year  "The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class telling anyone who'd listen that Black could turn into a flowering shrub." — Hannah's wild theory about Sirius Black[src]      Hannah studying with fellow Hufflepuffs   In 1993, her third year, when news got out that Sirius Black had escaped from Azkaban, Hannah held the belief that Black could transform himself into a flowering shrub to avoid detection, and would tell this theory to anyone who would listen.[16] Even though her theory of transforming into a shrub was incorrect, Sirius Black did in fact use a transformation to avoid detection and escape Azkaban; however, his transformation was into the form of a dog. Hannah's belief that Sirius could transform into a flowering shrub was likely to have originated from her liking of Herbology and the Professor of Herbology, Pomona Sprout, who was her Head of House.  Fourth year  Pomona Sprout: "An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples." Hannah: "Like poor Eloise Midgen. She tried to curse hers off." Pomona Sprout: "Silly girl. But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end." — Hannah and Professor Sprout during a fourth year Herbology class[src]      Hannah and Ernie Macmillan harassing Harry with their Support Cedric badges   During 1994, Hannah's fourth year, Hannah helped collect Bubotuber pus in Herbology, which Madam Pomfrey used for treating acne to prevent students from taking more desperate measures. Hannah noted that Eloise Midgen had tried to curse her pimples off.[17] This year Hogwarts hosted the Triwizard Tournament and Hannah's fellow Hufflepuff Cedric Diggory was one of the Triwizard finalists. Hannah fully supported him during the tournament's tasks, as he was also in Hufflepuff. Hannah was among the many Hufflepuffs who were displeased when Harry appeared to be usurping Cedric's rightful place, by becoming the second Hogwarts champion during the Triwizard Tournament, and she showed support only for her fellow Hufflepuff.[18]      Hannah with Ernie watching the Third Task of the tournament   This was because Hufflepuff never received much attention, and she, along with many others, felt Harry was taking the glory away from Diggory.[18] To show her support, she wore a Support CEDRIC DIGGORY — the REAL Hogwarts Champion! badge that was able to change to read POTTER STINKS.[19] Again, as in her second year, Hannah spent a lot of her free time revising in the Great Hall with Ernie Macmillan, presumably studying for her O.W.L.s which were coming up the following year. The two of them also attended at least one Hogsmeade weekend and were swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a table at The Three Broomsticks.[18] Later in this same year, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort, and Harry won the Triwizard Tournament, but this did not matter to Hannah, as Cedric's death made the winner rather irrelevant. Hannah was then presumably amongst the students that believed Harry Potter's claims that Lord Voldemort had indeed returned, and that the Second Wizarding War had really broken out.  Fifth year  Hannah: "I — I need to think. To remember! Oh, I'm never going to finish my revision!" Hermione Granger: "Well, we can help you with one subject — we're having our first Defence Against the Dark Arts meeting." Hannah: "M-meeting? But Umbridge has banned clubs. She'll see us going there! I'll fail my O.W.L.s! I'll be expelled! We'll all be expelled!" — Discussion of the D.A.'s meeting times and O.W.L.s[src]      The first ever meeting of Dumbledore's Army, that Hannah attended   In 1995, her fifth year, Hannah was made a prefect for Hufflepuff House, along with Ernie Macmillan.[5] Shortly after the beginning of term, it became apparent that Dolores Umbridge was not going to be teaching practical means of Defence Against the Dark Arts, and Hannah decided to join Dumbledore's Army, a secret Defence Against the Dark Arts group started by Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.[20] She was also one of the minority who believed that Lord Voldemort was back, likely due to the fact that Cedric Diggory, a student of her house, was claimed by Harry Potter to have been murdered by the Dark Lord in the previous year.      Dumbledore's Army in circle   The pressure of studying for her O.W.L.s had definitely got to Hannah, and she broke down in tears during a Herbology class, after claiming to be too stupid to take her exams. She was then taken to the Hospital Wing, where Madam Pomfrey treated her with a Calming Draught.[21] Despite being treated, Hannah still managed to let pressure get the better of her and during her Transfiguration practical exam, she accidentally multiplied a ferret into a flock of flamingos.[22] Hannah made it through the rest of her exams, and, approaching the end of the year, Hannah was one of the D.A. members who aided Harry when he was attacked by Draco Malfoy, Gregory Goyle, and Vincent Crabbe at the end of their fifth year, proving her loyalty and friendship still to Dumbledore's Army, even after its initial purpose had been rendered redundant.[23] At some point within the school year, she was a Charms Tutor, providing a service to fellow classmates to teach them charms.[6]  Sixth year  "There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since." — The death of Hannah's mother[src]      Sixth year Apparition lesson   In 1996, Hannah returned to her sixth year at Hogwarts. Early on during her sixth year, Hannah was told during a Herbology lesson that her mother, Mrs Abbott, had been murdered earlier in the day, presumably by Death Eaters. As a result of this, Hannah was subsequently pulled out of Hogwarts and did not return for the rest of the year.[9] She was not in school at the time of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore's demise at the hands of Severus Snape.[24] It is possible, as a result of missing most of her sixth year, Hannah would be required to retake the year's courses.  Seventh year  "Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it." — Hannah escapes death in the second half of  the final battle[src]      Hannah watching Neville Longbottom stand up to Death Eaters when they storm the Hogwarts Express   Hannah was compelled to return to Hogwarts in 1997, as Lord Voldemort had taken over the Ministry of Magic and attendance at Hogwarts had become mandatory for all pure or half-blood students; Muggle-borns had to go before a Muggle-Born Registration Commission prior to being admitted to Hogwarts. It is possible, as Hannah had missed her previous year of education, she would be made to resit the year, making her technically a sixth year student once again.       Hannah fighting during the Battle of Hogwarts[25]   Hannah was present on the train when it was stormed by Death Eaters in search of Harry Potter. She also witnessed fellow classmate Neville stand up to them and inform them that Harry was not aboard the train.[26] Whilst back at Hogwarts, Hannah became a member of the revived Dumbledore's Army, now operating under the leadership of Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, and Ginny Weasley in the absence of Harry, Ron and Hermione. United once again, Dumbledore's Army continued to train students in battle and defence, and the group ran riot around Hogwarts, making the life for new Headmaster Severus Snape and Death Eaters Amycus Carrow and Alecto Carrow difficult.[27]  Battle of Hogwarts When Harry Potter returned to Hogwarts on 1 May 1998, Hannah stayed at the school and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. She battled against Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort. Initially, she was part of the group of students led by Fred and George Weasley. Hannah's group was charged with defending the secret passages into Hogwarts from invading Death Eaters.[28]    Hannah witnesses Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, thus ending the Second Wizarding War  During the second stage of the battle, she witnessed Voldemort and his Death Eaters gloating over Harry's 'dead body'. She was then forced into the Great Hall, along with the other defenders of Hogwarts. Harry saved her and Seamus Finnigan with a Shield Charm when Lord Voldemort sent a curse their way. Hannah stood witness to Harry's final defeat of Voldemort, thus surviving the Second Wizarding War.[29] Later life (1998-2014)  "Neville Longbottom, now a popular Herbology teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is here in Patagonia with his wife Hannah. Until recently the pair lived above the Leaky Cauldron in London, but rumour has it that Hannah has not only retrained as a Healer, but is applying for the job of Matron at Hogwarts. Idle gossip suggests that she and her husband both enjoy a little more Ogden's Old Firewhisky than most of us would expect from custodians of our children, but no doubt we all wish her the best of luck with her application." — DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL[src]  Having missed a year in education it is likely that, like Hermione Granger, Hannah would resit the same year and they would graduate together in 1999. Some time before 2014, Hannah married her former classmate and leader of the student rebellion, Neville Longbottom. She became the landlady at the Leaky Cauldron, replacing Tom, and the couple lived together above the pub. Neville's students considered the fact they lived above the pub "cool".[30] Hannah eventually gave up being landlady of the Leaky Cauldron and decided to train as a healer. She applied for the job of Matron at Hogwarts. On 8 July 2014, Rita Skeeter scathingly reported that she and Neville enjoyed 'a little more Ogden's Firewhisky than most would expect from custodians of our children'.[3] Since Rita enjoyed fabricating information to slander people, it is likely that her statement was untrue.  Physical description Hannah was described as a pink-faced girl with blonde hair. In her younger years, she usually wore pigtails.[8]  Personality and traits Hannah appeared to have a naive streak since she was easily convinced by Ernie that Harry might be the Heir of Slytherin, despite having always considered him to be nice.[13] She also believed that Sirius Black could turn into a flowering shrub (although, given that he was, in fact, an Animagus, the belief wasn't too far from the truth).[16] Hannah was easily flustered and appeared to lack self-confidence, as was evidenced by her breakdown in Herbology and her claims of being stupid.[21] It seemed that, when under pressure, she was prone to making mistakes.[22] Despite this, Hannah was a loyal friend and showed her bravery firstly by joining Dumbledore's Army,[20] and then fighting in the defence of Hogwarts.[28]  Magical abilities and skills Defence Against the Dark Arts: Hannah joined Dumbledore's Army in her fifth year,[20] and learned how to cast various defensive and offensive spells, under the masterful teaching of Harry Potter.[23] Duelling: Hannah helped retaliate against Draco Malfoy and his friends when they tried to gang up on and attack Harry Potter, where she and her friends managed to jinx and hex them into having the appearances of slugs.[23] She also impressively fought in and survived the Battle of Hogwarts, showing her to have been an excellent duellist with considerable proficiency in martial magic.[28][29] Herbology: Hannah achieved a high mark on her O.W.L. exam. In her sixth year she attended N.E.W.T. Herbology classes, showing her proficiency in the subject.[9] Healing: In her adulthood, Hannah trained to become a Healer and applied for the position of the Hogwarts Matron, meaning she would have been very accomplished and learned in healing magic, including with healing spells, potions and other magical remedies.[3] Charms: Hannah was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal Patronus.[11] This is a mark of superior magical ability, given how difficult the said charm is to perform. She likely learned how to cast the spell whilst attending Dumbledore's Army meetings. She was also likely gifted at teaching others about charms, serving as a Charms Tutor in her fifth year.[6] Possessions Wand: Hannah owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, wood and core material. Like most witches and wizards in Great Britain, she presumably purchased it from Ollivanders in Diagon Alley, London, prior to starting her first year at Hogwarts in 1991. She would have wielded her wand throughout her school life, and during the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. Leaky Cauldron: After graduating from Hogwarts, Hannah eventually become the Landlady of the Leaky Cauldron, the popular wizarding pub in Diagon Alley, thus becoming its owner. Prefect badge: Hannah owned a Hufflepuff Prefect badge, prior to becoming a Prefect at the start of the 1995–1996 school year, which she would have worn during her Prefect duties. Potter Stinks badge: At the start of the Triwizard Tournament in 1994, Hannah owned and wore one of these enchanted badges to show her contempt for Harry Potter becoming the second Hogwarts champion, believing he was stealing Cedric Diggory's limelight. She stopped wearing hers after becoming a supporter of Harry during the Tournament. Relationships Neville Longbottom     Neville Longbottom, her future husband   Although it appeared that Hannah and Neville Longbottom were rarely ever together during their school days, and given that Hannah supported Cedric Diggory in their fourth year, their friendship probably evolved from their time in Dumbledore's Army together, and during the student rebellion during their seventh year, as well as just being in the same year and sharing classes for so long — particularly Herbology, Neville's best subject, which the Gryffindors shared with the Hufflepuffs. It is possible that Hannah and Neville both found comfort in each other during their seventh year, since in the previous year Hannah's mother had been killed by Death Eaters, and Neville would understand how she would be feeling as Death Eaters tortured his parents into insanity. Hannah joined Dumbledore's Army under the leadership of Neville, and in the absence of Harry, and proved her loyalty to him throughout the Battle of Hogwarts. Following the Second Wizarding War, Hannah and Neville became closer and eventually married. Neville became the new Professor of Herbology at Hogwarts, taking over from Professor Sprout, whilst Hannah became the new landlady of the Leaky Cauldron, taking over from Tom. The couple lived together above the pub, a fact that Neville's students thought was 'cool'.[30] Hannah eventually applied for the job of Matron at Hogwarts, which could have brought her closer to Neville, if she managed to gain the position.  Ernie Macmillan     Ernie Macmillan, her friend and house mate   Hannah and Ernie Macmillan were close friends during their time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, both having been sorted into the house of Hufflepuff during their first year. During their second year they both discussed the possibility of Harry being the Heir of Slytherin after the Chamber of Secrets had been declared open. Hannah had her doubts, as she thought Harry was nice, but Ernie was easily able to sway her opinion.[13] Both Hannah and Ernie shared the hobby of collecting Chocolate Frog Cards.[18] They also both supported Cedric Diggory as the School Champion during the Triwizard Tournament, as many Hufflepuffs and even Ravenclaws did, and both shared a certain irritation with Harry Potter, the other champion.[18] In 1995, they both became the Hufflepuff prefects[5] and joined Dumbledore's Army.[20] Unlike Hannah, Ernie was able to keep his cool during his O.W.L.s.[22]  Justin Finch-Fletchley Hannah and Justin Finch-Fletchley were close friends during their time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, both having been sorted into the house of Hufflepuff during their first year. During their second year they both discussed the possibility of Harry being the Heir of Slytherin after the Chamber of Secrets had been declared open.[13] Both Hannah and Justin joined Dumbledore's Army.[20]  Susan Bones Hannah and Susan were roommates and friends during Hogwarts, and sat together in the train while going to Hogwarts.[26] Both joined Dumbledore's Army and both fought in the Battle of Hogwarts.  Etymology 'Hannah' is from the Hebrew name חַנָּה (Channah) which meant 'favour' or "grace'. Hannah was the mother of the prophet Samuel in the Old Testament. As an English name, Hannah was not regularly used until after the Protestant Reformation.[31] 'Hannah' sounds almost identical to the Japanese word for flower, 花 (romanised 'Hana'). As such, it could be taken as part of the pattern of flower names, which includes Lily J. Potter, Lily L. Potter, Rose Granger-Weasley, Fleur Delacour, Petunia Evans and others. However, it is very likely that this is simply a coincidence, given that the name is of Hebrew origin and means something else. 'Abbott' is a Middle English surname.[32] An abbot was a church position below the pope, archbishops and bishops in the Church hierarchy in the Middle Ages. The ancestors of people with the surname Abbott probably were abbots or abbesses in medieval times (900-1300). Behind the scenes     Hannah as she appears on  Pottermore   During the O.W.L.s, Hannah Abbott was doing her Transfiguration practical at the same time as Harry Potter. This is odd as the examinations are done by surname, meaning that Hannah should have finished a while earlier. One possible explanation is that the lists for that examination were mistakenly compiled by first name. Another is that Hannah's exam took an unusually long time, possibly due to her nerves.[22] Harry Potter and Hermione Granger saw the grave of someone named 'Abbott' when they visited Godric's Hollow in 1997. This may have been the grave of a relative of Hannah's, perhaps indicating that her family, like the Potters, come from Godric's Hollow. While Hannah's mother was revealed to be killed by the Death Eaters, her father's fate was left unknown, indicating that he was either alive or deceased by 1996. So, Hannah may have possibly been left an orphan after her mother's death. Alternatively, her father could have been the one who pulled her out of Hogwarts.     Hannah Abbott as she appears in the Order of the Phoenix video game   Hannah Abbott was portrayed by Charlotte Skeoch in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, as well as voicing the character for the game Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. She was portrayed by Louisa Warren in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in a background role. She is one of the Original Forty students listed by J. K. Rowling along with Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley. From early production notes viewed in the 2001 television special, Harry Potter and Me, Hannah was supposed to be a Muggle-born witch.[33] However, J. K. Rowling stated in an interview that she always considered Hannah to be a pure-blood. To compromise, she was officially made a half-blood.[2] In the credits of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, she is listed as 'Hannah Hufflepuff'.[34] In the sorting scene in the the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Hermione Granger gets called up first instead of Hannah Abbott. An Alice Abbott was accused of witchcraft during the Northamptonshire witch trials of 1612. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 48 images related to Hannah Abbott.
