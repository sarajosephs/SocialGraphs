Behind the scenes In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, a dragon is shown guarding the high security vaults at Gringotts, contradicting the earlier revelation that sphinxes were used as guards in the Daily Prophet Newsletters. However, this dragon escaped during the Gringotts break-in on 1 May 1998, causing substantial damage to the bank in the process. Twiddle's letter was published in the 31 July 1998 issue of the Daily Prophet Newsletters,[2] so it's possible that Gringotts decided to switch to using sphinxes to guard its high security vaults after the break-in, in the hope of preventing further such incidents from occurring.
