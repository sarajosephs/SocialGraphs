He'll never have another peaceful moment..." — Seamus Finnigan on Apparition[src]  Fergus (fl. 1979-1996) was an Irish wizard and Seamus Finnigan's cousin. He was known to annoy Seamus by Apparating around him frequently.[2]  Contents  1 Magical abilities and skills 2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Magical abilities and skills Apparition: Fergus was capable of apparating at will, often doing it to simply annoy his cousin Seamus.[2] Etymology The name "Fergus" means "man of vigour", derived from the Gaelic elements fear "man" and gus "vigour". This was the name of several characters in Irish legend including the Ulster hero Fearghas mac Róich.  Behind the scenes The fact that Fergus was a wizard suggests that he was related to Seamus through Mrs Finnigan.
