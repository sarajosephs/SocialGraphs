Pre 31 August 1984[1]   Nationality British or Irish[2]   Title(s) Beater    Physical information  Species Human   Gender Male    Affiliation  House Gryffindor   Loyalty Sloper familyHogwarts School of Witchcraft and WizardryGryffindorGryffindor Quidditch team   [Source]  Jack Sloper was a wizard and substitute Beater on the Gryffindor Quidditch team in 1995. Along with Andrew Kirke, he took over for Fred Weasley and George Weasley. Jack was unsuccessful in rejoining the team the next year.  Contents  1 Biography 2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography He and Andrew were both described as incompetent by Angelina Johnson;[3] this was particularly evident when Jack knocked himself unconscious with his own bat.[4] He expressed interest in continuing to play for Gryffindor, but was replaced the following year. Jack later delivered a message for Albus Dumbledore to Harry Potter with the details of their first lesson. He also asked Harry when tryouts would be held for Quidditch.[5]  Etymology Jack derives from John, which means "God (Herbrew) is gracious". Sloper could come from the English word slope,a surface in which one side is higher than the other. This could relate to his inability to do things right, since slopes have been described as very hard to climb for some people.
