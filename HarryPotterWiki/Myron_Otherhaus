Described as "very handsome," he was resided in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.[1]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography One day in 1855, Violet Tillyman unexpectedly tumbled out of Myron's fireplace via the Floo Network, having left her home after a nasty argument with her bullying husband, Albert. In a distressed state, she had tried to say, "I want to go to Mother's house", but the words had not come out clearly between her sobs and hiccoughs. However, despite Violet's red, tear-streaked face and ash-covered clothing, she and Myron immediately fell in love with each other.[1] For the next twenty years, Myron and Violet lived together in seclusion in Bury St Edmunds, having seven children. After Albert's death in 1875, Violet finally chose to resurface publicly, and she and Myron lived together happily for the rest of their lives.[1]  Behind the scenes If Myron and Violet never married, as seems to be the case, this would make their seven children the only characters within Harry Potter canon known to have been born to non-married parents, until the addition of Delphini in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.
