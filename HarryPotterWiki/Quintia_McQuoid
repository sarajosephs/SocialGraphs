Quintia McQuoid would be proud — as most of you know, this Championship has been held in this garden every seven years since 1407 in honour of Quintia McQuoid, that most memorable of potioneers, whose love affair with potions sadly came to an end with her untimely death from drinking an imperfectly-brewed cure for ague." — The Wizarding Schools Potions Championship announcer[src]  Quintia McQuoid (died c. 1407) was a notable Medieval witch and Potioneer, active in, at least, the early 15th century.[1]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography She died at a young age, after consuming a cure for ague that had been improperly brewed. To honour her memory, the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship was first held, in an enchanted garden, in 1407, and has been held every seven years since, gathering Potions students from schools like Hogwarts, Mahoutokoro, Uagadou, and Koldovstoretz.[1]  Magical abilities and skills Potions: McQuoid was considered a famous potioneer, implying she was very skilled with potion-making, although her improperly-brewed cure for ague killed her.[1] Appearances Wonderbook: Book of Potions (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 Wonderbook: Book of Potions (see this video)     Potions (class)      Potioneers   Arsenius Jigger · Bilius Finbok · Blossom Degrasse · Dai Ryusaki · Damocles Belby · Erica Stainwright · Fleamont Potter · Gethsemane Prickle · Gilderoy Lockhart · Glossy · Glover Hipworth · Golpalott · Gregory the Smarmy · Gunhilda de Gorsemoor · Hector Dagworth-Granger · Hesper Starkey · J.
