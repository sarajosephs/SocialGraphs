They contained a single spine taken from the back of one of the White River Monsters native to Arkansas.[3] Initially, there were fears that the species was being over-fished, but the ecological impact was lessened by the fact that only Quintana knew how to lure the creatures.[3] He fiercely guarded this secret up until his death, after which wands containing White River Monster spine cores were no longer made.[3]  Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film) (mentioned on wand permit application) Notes and references   ↑ Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film) (see this image) - He was likely of age by the time he was a recognised wandmaker in 1926.  ↑ According to  Pottermore, Quintana produced wands during the 1920s, which means he could not have died before 1930.  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 Writing by J.
