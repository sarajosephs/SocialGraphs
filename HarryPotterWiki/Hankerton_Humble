He was hired by the founders of Hogwarts themselves, and began the never-ending caretaker tradition of hating Peeves.[4]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography Hankerton was born sometime in the Middle Ages, presumably in Great Britain or Ireland given that Hogwarts only accepts students from there.[4] Soon after the founding of Hogwarts, he was accepted as the caretaker there. During his time, he started the everlasting tradition of caretakers' hating Peeves; it is unknown how he got along with the students, though judging by his name it may have been fairly well. Sometime before 1876, however, he had retired and was succeeded (though by how many generations is unknown) by Rancorous Carpe.[4]  Etymology Hankerton is a town in Wiltshire, known for its ancient church. Humble means "meek", or "polite", possibly reflecting on his personality. Humble could also be short for "humblebee" another term for "bumblebee."
