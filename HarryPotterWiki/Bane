Bane   Physical information  Species Centaur[1]   Gender Male[1]   Hair colour Black[2]    Affiliation  Loyalty Forbidden Forest centaur colony[1]Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[3]   [Source]    "Firenze! What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?" — Bane's hostility towards humans[src]  Bane was a centaur living as part of the Forbidden Forest Centaur colony.[1]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 1992 1.2 1995–1996 school year 1.3 Battle of Hogwarts 1.4 2010–2011 school year 1.5 2020   2 Physical description 3 Magical abilities and skills 4 Etymology 5 Behind the scenes 6 Appearances 7 Notes and references   Biography 1992  "For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!" — Bane's anger at Firenze for helping Harry Potter[src]  Late in May of 1992, Bane and Firenze foretold Harry Potter's future by reading the stars; “Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have you not read what is to come in the movement of the planets?”. He also chastised Firenze, questioning if he was a common mule as he carried Harry Potter on his back.[1]  1995–1996 school year  Dolores Umbridge: "By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as yourselves on a human —" Bane: "What did you call us?" — Bane to Dolores Umbridge[src]     The centaurs taking Umbridge   Bane was included in the centaur mobs that forced Harry, Hermione Granger and Rubeus Hagrid out of the Forbidden Forest after they visited Grawp.[4] he was also present when the centaurs attacked Dolores Umbridge, after Umbridge called them "filthy half-breeds". He shouted at Umbridge's insults at them and shot an arrow above her head as a mocking threat, then lifted her from behind and helped drag her off into the midst of the forest.[5]  Battle of Hogwarts  "The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the Hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges." — Bane and the other centaurs finally joining the battle in the Great Hall[src]     Bane   During the Battle of Hogwarts, Bane and the other centaurs did not join the battle. When it looked like Harry had sacrificed himself, Hagrid called him a coward. This shamed him and the other centaurs so much that they decided to join the battle, breaking through the Death Eater ranks into the Hall.[3]  2010–2011 school year  "Young witches and wizards should not venture into the forest alone. It is not safe." — Bane to the students[src]      Bane and students encountering Acromantulas   During the 2010–2011 school year, Bane encountered Daniel Page, Ivy Warrington and another student in the Forbidden Forest looking for a Firebolt Supreme and warned them that the forest was not safe. He showed them the way out, but when Ivy found the rogue Snitch they had also been searching for and took it off a web, they were attacked by some Acromantulas.[6]  2020 In 2020, Bane spoke with Harry Potter in the Forbidden Forest while Harry and others are searching for his lost son Albus. According to Bane, after the Battle of Hogwarts, the land they were currently trespassing on was deemed centaur land. Bane warned Harry that he has seen a black cloud over his son, foreboding a threat that could endanger them all.[7]  Physical description Bane was physically described as being black haired and black bodied and wild looking, with a black beard.[2]  Magical abilities and skills  "Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?" — Bane's attitude towards Divination[src]  Divination: Like many centaurs, Bane possessed the ability to read the stars, planets, and other celestial bodies in order to predict the future.[1] Archery: Bane was seen to be very skilled at aiming his arrow at Dolores Umbridge so that it simply "grazed her mousy brown hair" to frighten her after she claimed that the Forest belonged to the Ministry of Magic.[5] Etymology A "bane" is something that (1) is a constant source of unhappiness or worry; (2) can cause injury or death or (3) a poison. The word comes from the old English bana. Behind the scenes The centaur Bane is voiced and portrayed by the British actor Jason Piper in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and by Nuno Silva in the original West End Palace Theatre production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Bane was never addressed by name, but there was only one of the Centaurs who had a black coat. In the book, Bane solely carried Umbridge off into the forest during the Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest, but in the film she was carried off by two Centaurs, neither of which seemed to be Bane. The book Harry Potter: The Creature Vault incorrectly claims that Bane was the one who told Harry Potter about the properties of unicorn blood, although it was Firenze in both the book and film.
