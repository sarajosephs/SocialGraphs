She was described to be a motherly-looking healer.[3]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 1990–1991 school year 1.2 1995   2 Personality and traits 3 Magical abilities and skills 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography During her youth, she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In her adult years, she once commented to Jacob's sibling that Herbology was not her best subject at school.[6] Strout was a good friend of Talbott Winger's mother, a fellow Healer employed at St Mungo's and a White Swan Animagus. Upon her tragic death, Strout was heartbroken, and in response, her Patronus changed to the shape of a White Swan, to commemorate her. She would often let it patrol the hospital to remind her of Talbott Winger's mother doing the same.[4]  1990–1991 school year  "It's so wonderful to see you, my little lambs! Welcome to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies. My name is Miriam Strout and I'll be your supervisor while you're here! The healing arts are complex and vital to the wizarding world, but I'll be here to help you along! For your school project, you'll be learning about the foundations of healing and what it means to be a Healer." — Miriam Strout greeting seventh-year Hogwarts students to the hospital[src]     Miriam Strout greeting seventh-year students to the hospital   During this school year at Hogwarts, Strout helped seventh-year students visiting St Mungo's to complete assignments as part of their work experience at the hospital.[2][7][8][5] During this time, she treated Jacob in the hospital, who had been suffering from life-threatening burns,[8] that were caused by the dark charm Protego Diabolica. Jacob's sibling informed Strout of the nature of Jacob's injuries once they had realised it themselves, and Strout immediately modified his treatment, managing to successfully save his life.[9] Strout became a victim of the laughing curse that was attached to a cursed CD case that been given to Jacob at the hospital as a supposed get-well gift.[10][11] With Strout bedridden due to the curse, which made her not stop laughing, the hospital fell into disarray with her patients becoming restless.[11] Thankfully, Jacob's sibling destroyed the cursed CD case at Hogwarts, and Strout and the others were freed of the curse. She treated the affected patients with lozenges and fortifying broth. She then proceeded to inform Talbott Winger, Jacob and their sibling of her White Swan Patronus, and how it reflected her friendship with Talbott's mother, as the presence of her Patronus had mystified the students. She also gifted Talbott with his mother's St Mungo's Certified Healer Insignia, with Talbott commenting that he intended to become a Healer himself.[4] Jacob's sibling asked Strout if she knew anyone called Burke whilst she was busy in the Alchemy Room, whom they suspected was a Dark Wizard responsible for the laughing curse outbreak. She was surprised at this suggestion, she told them Burke was a resident healer who had worked at the hospital for many years, and she said she planned to talk to him, but had to urgently leave to attend a meeting.[12] She later told Jacob's sibling their work experience had finished when Alastor Moody came to pick them and Jacob up. She thanked them for their work immensely and told them they would achieve great things.[13]  1995  "Look, Broderick, you've been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy Hippogriff for each month." — Miriam Strout's fatal mistake[src]     Miriam Strout tending to patients in the Janus Thickey Ward at Christmas   Strout was responsible for looking after long-term patients such as Agnes, Gilderoy Lockhart, and Alice and Frank Longbottom. When Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron and Ginny Weasley came up to the Janus Thickey Ward by accident, she led them in, mistaking them wanting to visit Lockhart, who had managed to sneak out of his room for a while.[3] She was also looking after Broderick Bode when he was killed by a Devil's Snare plant sent to him by the Death Eater Walden Macnair, disguised at the time as an elderly wizard. Although St Mungo's had very strict regulations of the gifts allowed into the hospital, Strout mistook the Devil Snare to be a harmless Flitterbloom and thought the improving Bode could take care of it, a dreadful mistake which cost him his life. She was suspended on full pay whilst the matter was investigated and was unavailable for comments for the Daily Prophet.[14] It is unknown if Strout was eventually fired or reinstated in her position.  Personality and traits  "Oh Gilderoy, you’ve got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas Day too! Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can’t think why, he’s such a sweetie, aren’t you?" — Strout's compassion for Gilderoy Lockhart[src]  Strout was evidently a very caring and kind-hearted witch, given her job as a Healer, meaning she specialised in tending to the both the physically and mentally unwell, in the Janus Thickey Ward. She was very mothering and protective of her vulnerable patients, such as Gilderoy Lockhart, who she even seemed to feel much compassion for, since he received no visitors.[3] However, she was somewhat naive and inattentive in her professional duties, as she foolishly failed to identify a lethal Devil's Snare plant that had been brought into her hospital ward (mistaking it for a harmless Flitterbloom), a thoughtless mistake which resulted in her patient Broderick Bode being killed by the plant, and her being suspended from her position.[14]  Magical abilities and skills  Talbott Winger: "The Swan Patronus has been looking out for us, after all." Miriam Strout: "That's more true than you know, Mr Winger. For you see, the one who conjured the Patronus was... me." Jacob's sibling: "You, Madam Strout?" Miriam Strout: "None other. It goes back to when your mother passed. She and I were very close. With her gone, I was heartbroken. Eventually, my Patronus changed to resemble her Animagus form. The most beautiful swan! Now, whenever I think of her, I conjure my Patronus and watch it roam these halls just as she once did." — Strout revealing her Patronus form[src]  Healing magic: As a professional Healer working at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Strout was highly proficient in the art of medical magic. She worked in the Janus Thickey Ward, meaning she was very able in looking after people who had suffered permanent spell damage.[3] In addition, in order to have trained as a Healer, she would have needed N.E.W.T.s in Charms, Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration and Defence Against the Dark Arts, all at least "Exceeds Expectations" or "Outstanding" level.[15] Despite Herbology being a requirement, she failed to identify a cutting of Devil's Snare, mistaking it for a harmless Flitterbloom, costing Bode his life.[14]     Strout's White Swan Patronus pointing to a cursed CD case   Charms: Strout was highly capable in charm-work, given how a N.E.W.T. was required in Charms for all Healers;[15] furthermore, she was capable of unlocking the locked door to the Janus Thickey Ward with the Unlocking Charm, as well as fixing a fancy hippogriff calendar to the wall with her wand for Broderick Bode.[3] She could also produce a fully corporeal Patronus in the form of a White Swan, which changed form to resemble the Animagus form of Talbott Winger's mother.[4] Potions: Strout was knowledgeable of various healing potions,[2] and was skilled in brewing them at St Mungo's in the Alchemy Room in order to heal her patients.[7] Potions was also a required qualification for Healers like Strout.[15] Defence Against the Dark Arts: As a Healer, she would have needed an O.W.L. in this subject at either "Exceeds Expectations" or "Outstanding".[15] Strout was able to heal Jacob of life-threatening burns sustained from the powerful dark charm Protego Diabolica, showing she was skilled with dealing with medical conditions caused by the Dark Arts.[9] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 22 images related to Miriam Strout.
