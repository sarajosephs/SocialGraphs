She appeared to be Grindelwald's personal lieutenant.[8]  Invasion of Parisian house    Vinda, Gellert, and Abernathy in the home   Several months following his escape from MACUSA custody, Grindelwald, accompanied by Vinda and his other acolytes, travelled to Paris to find and enlist Credence Barebone. As he strode through the streets of Paris, Grindelwald was accompanied by Rosier and the two beheld Vinda's fellow acolytes kill the owners of a house, making it their hiding place, after which she spoke to Grindelwald about the world in which they would be able to freely kill every single non-magic person, but he told her that they would not kill every single one (that they wished only to bring freedom and the "beast of burden" would always be necessary).[8]     Vinda watching Gellert as he shares his vision of Credence to them   While situated in the home used as headquarters, Vinda watched as Gellert Grindelwald used his skull-hookah to show them Credence Barebone's Obscurus, explaining that Barebone was the "only known entity alive that could kill Albus Dumbledore". In the French Ministry of Magic she enabled Abernathy, under the disguise of an elderly lady, to safely depart from the Ministry with a stolen Lestrange family box from the Records Room.[8]  Finding Queenie     Vinda with Queenie stalling for Gellert   Later on, Vinda located a distraught Queenie Goldstein and brought her to the house being used by the Alliance. At the headquarters, she comforted her and provided her with tea. When Queenie informed her, she intended to leave so she could find her sister Tina, Vinda, also rising, told her she had yet to meet her host, which Queenie took as an implication she was married. When asked this however, Vinda instead mysteriously confessed her relationship with Grindelwald was one of "deep commitment", then left to bring her master, who entered the room and implored Goldstein to join him.[8]  Attending the rally     Rosier with skull-hookah  Rosier attended the subsequent rally of Grindelwald's at the Lestrange Mausoleum as one of his acolytes. Vinda listened in on a conversation between Nagini and Credence Barebone about pure-blood's hatred towards people like them, while leaning on a wall.[9] She went onstage to give Grindelwald a skull hookah to show everyone visions of the violence, warfare and bloodshed of the non-magical people, more specifically visions of the future Second World War.       Vinda in the circle of flames  After a young witch with red hair was killed by an Auror after she tried to attack him, Grindelwald in response to the Aurors' opposition to him, Gellert conjured a circle of protective fire around himself to test the loyalty of his followers, among which Vinda was the first to join him; she stepped into the blue flames unaffected and unharmed, as she was truly loyal to him and his cause. Unlike her fellow acolytes (bar Krall, who perished trying to cross) who disapparated away after they passed through, Vinda remained by Grindelwald's side and beheld his confrontation with the Aurors and Newt Scamander, as well as Queenie, Credence and several Aurors decision to join him.      Vinda dissapparating away from the Lestrange Mausoleum   Whilst still holding Grindelwald's skull hookah, Leta Lestrange destroyed it with a powerful spell, which caused it to explode, knocking Rosier backwards. After that, she disapparated away intending to spread Grindelwald's words and message to the wider wizarding world, as all of his followers had been commanded to do.[8]  1930s     Rosier killing a Qilin with a green spell   In 1932, Vinda was among the group of acolytes who attacked Newt Scamander while he was tending to a Qilin in the Tianzi Mountains, China. She cast a green dark charm at the mother Qilin, which fatally injured it.[2] When Rosier and Grindelwald were talking about Credence at Nurmengard Castle, Grindelwald told Rosier that he needed Credence to defeat Albus Dumbledore. She and Carrow attended an election rally at the German Ministry of Magic and burned a sign of Santos's supporters and created a commotion there. Vinda sat by Grindelwald's side in the carriage that took him to the candidates' dinner at the German Ministry of Magic, she along with Grindelwald's assistants attended the dinner where she sat by Grindelwald's side.      Rosier with Anton Vogel and Credence Barebone in Nurmengard   Rosier watched Grindelwald reanimate his dead Qilin in Nurmengard with necromancy, with Anton Vogel and Credence Barebone.[2]      Grindelwald signals Rosier to bring Jacob forth   Vinda later accompanied Grindelwald to the 1932 International Confederation of Wizards' Supreme Mugwump election in Bhutan. On Grindelwald's orders, she brought Jacob to Grindelwald in order to torture him. She witnessed Grindelwald being defeated by Vicência Santos and escaping. She may have been apprehended due to her being surrounded by Albus Dumbledore and several powerful Aurors, witches, and wizards such as Liu Tao, Ida Webb, Victor, Theseus Scamander, and more.[2]  Personality and traits  Vinda: "When we've won, they'll flee cities in the millions. They've had their time." Grindelwald: "We don't say such things out loud. We want only freedom. Freedom to be ourselves." Vinda: "To annihilate non-wizards." — Vinda regarding her views on the Non-magic community[src]  Rosier was a mysteriously charming and ultimately malevolent witch, who was an avowed and loyal follower of the Dark Wizard Gellert Grindelwald, and supported his vision of wizarding supremacy over non-magical humans and their world. Vinda was outwardly courteous, sophisticated, and refined, and despite her deeply sinister ideology, could show kindness to those in need when it suited her to do so, as shown when she comforted and invited in a distraught Queenie Goldstein off the raining streets of Paris, for tea in Grindelwald's abode. However, her motivation for doing this, would appear to be unknowingly place Queenie under Grindelwald's presence and influence, in the hope of recruiting new followers to his sinister cause.[8] Indeed, despite her seeming benevolent and full of good will, Vinda was in reality a very ill-intentioned witch, who desired to see wizards and witches rise up above non-magical peoples and rule them, or alternatively exterminate them. This lack of concern for the non-magical was made evident when she watched Carrow, Nagel and the other Acolytes murdered the Non-Magique couple who owned the home, which they used as a temporary hideout. Ultimately, unlike most other followers of Grindelwald, Vinda was loyal to Grindelwald's true vision, but was more extreme, and proudly stated that she wanted the extermination of all non-magical individuals.[8]  Magical abilities and skills Apparition: Vinda was fully capable of Apparating at will, as she managed to successfully Disapparate from the Lestrange Mausoleum.[8] Dark Arts: Rosier was able to fatally injure a female Qilin with a nonverbal green dark charm.[2] Nonverbal magic: Rosier was capable of casting spells nonverbally with ease.[2] Possessions Wand: Rosier was able to wield this wand in the 1930s.[2] Relationships Gellert Grindelwald     Her master, Gellert Grindelwald   Vinda was arguably Gellert Grindelwald's most trusted and loyal Acolyte, therefore being the Dark Wizard's anonymous lieutenant. Grindelwald trusted her with consoling Queenie Goldstein to soften her up for Grindelwald to convince her and also with keeping his Skull-Hookah, displaying his deep trust for Vinda.  When Vinda casually and proudly stated that Grindelwald's new order would bring the destruction of all Non-magic people and have them fleeing their cities in the millions, he told her they don't say such things out loud, but that they only want the freedom to be themselves and that they would not eliminate all muggles since the beast of burden would always be necessary.[8]  Etymology The name "Vinda" is a word of primarily Germanic/Norse origin that means "to wind; twist; wring." Rosier is, most notable, the name of a fallen angel (a Dominion of the Second Sphere) and patron demon of tainted love and seduction. In the Christian angelic hierarchy, Dominions regulate the duties of lower angels, and make themselves physically known to humans with extreme rarity. Rosier is also a French name that means "rose bush" or "from the rose bush." Behind the scenes     Rosier's Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore promotional poster   Vinda Rosier is portrayed by Poppy Corby-Tuech in the second and third instalments[10] of the Fantastic Beasts film series.[4] Her name is given only as "Rosier (female)" in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay, but her first name was revealed on  Pottermore. Vinda is similar to Bellatrix Lestrange because they both served as deputy to dark wizards (Vinda to Grindelwald and Bellatrix to Voldemort). It is also possible that they're both related because the family name of Bellatrix's mother Druella before her marriage was Rosier, and therefore Vinda could be a maternal relative of Bellatrix. It is possible Vinda Rosier was educated at Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, France's main wizarding school. Her wand bears great resemblance to both non-canonical Albus Dumbledore's original wand, as well as the Elder Wand, as all three wands have bumps going up and down their lengths.
