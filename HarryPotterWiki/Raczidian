For many years, he and the unearthly denizens of the castle co-existed peacefully with the villagers, leaving them alone, while they in kind kept out of the part of the woods where his castle was located.[1] One day, Raczidian noticed a beautiful girl from the village, Eliana, while she was collecting berries in the woods. Taken by her, he decided she would make an ideal wife, and sent a message to her parents demanding her hand. They refused. Raczidian thus threatened to send his Dementors to destroy the village unless Eliana was brought to him.[1] The villagers opted to put up a fight rather than surrender to Raczidian's ultimatum. At first, they succeeded in holding at bay the Dementors that Raczidian unleashed upon them with the combined might of their Patronuses, but gradually the sheer number of foes began to overwhelm them. Just when it looked as if all hope was lost, however, Illyius — a shy, young orphan who had been told to sit out the battle because the village elders thought his Patronus was too feeble to be of any use — cast the Patronus Charm. The mouse that sprang from Illyius's wand shone brilliantly and brought the Dementors to a halt.[1]     Raczidian's demise   Enraged that something so small should thwart him, Raczidian decided to enter the fray himself and attempted to summon a Patronus to ward off Illyius's mouse. However, he failed to remember that only the pure of heart could produce a Patronus, and thus for the first time in history, it was revealed what happened when a competent but unworthy wizard or witch attempted the spell: maggots shot out of Raczidian's wand and quickly devoured him as they engulfed his body.[1]  Magical abilities and skills Dark Arts: Raczidian was a feared Dark Wizard, meaning he would have been accomplished with Dark Magic. He was known to command Dementors successfully.[1] Possessions Wand: Raczidian owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, wood and core.[1] Castle: Raczidian owned and lived in a black castle in a dark forest, with a colony of Dementors.[1] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 2 images related to Raczidian.
