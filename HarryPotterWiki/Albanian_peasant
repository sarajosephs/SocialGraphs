Albanian peasant   Biographical information  Died After 1946[1]   Blood status Muggle[1]   Nationality Albanian[1]    Physical information  Species Human[1]   [Source]   This peasant was a Muggle who was born in Albania. When Tom Marvolo Riddle had found Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem, he killed the peasant and used the death to turn the priceless relic into a Horcrux.[1]  Behind the scenes Albus Dumbledore speculated that Voldemort was reserving the creation of his Horcruxes via significant murders.[2] This means that this individual played an important role in Voldemort's life, or that Dumbledore's speculation was incorrect (as he admitted he was not perfect, proven with his incorrect belief that Voldemort used Frank Bryce's murder to create his final Horcrux when it was in fact Bertha Jorkins).
