While Calderón is a real surname, it was probably picked because of its similarity with "caldero", meaning "cauldron".  Behind the scenes Josefina was not featured on the Sayre family tree on  Pottermore, but was however on the Gaunt family tree.[2] Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.12 1.13 1.14 1.15 1.16 1.17 1.18 Writing by J.
