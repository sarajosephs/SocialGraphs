Herbert Beery   Biographical information  Born No later than between 1948 and 1954[1]   Nationality British or Irish[2]   Title(s) Professor[3]    Physical information  Species Human[3]   Gender Male[3]    Affiliation  Occupation Professor of Herbology (? - before 1965-1971)[4]Professor at the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts (before 1965-1971 - ?)[3]   Loyalty Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[3]Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts[3]   [Source]    "Professor Beery, in his role of director, had been dangerously oblivious to the emotional entanglements seething under his very nose." — The disastrous The Fountain of Fair Fortune pantomime[src]  Professor Herbert Beery was a wizard and a professor of Herbology at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was the Herbology teacher while Armando Dippet was the Headmaster.[3] Beery was an enthusiastic devotee of amateur dramatics. Beery later left Hogwarts (sometime before Dippet left the post between 1965 and 1971) to teach at the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts (W.A.D.A).[3]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Career at Hogwarts   2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Career at Hogwarts At some point, Beery was employed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and became Professor of Herbology. Later, The Fountain of Fair Fortune fable was adapted into a pantomime by Professor Beery during the Yuletide for the students at Hogwarts. It resulted in a fire caused by an Engorged Ashwinder, and a duel involving the two lead actresses—one of whom had been romantically involved with the lead actor until shortly before the curtain rose, and had been spurned in favour of the other.[3] Beery was caught in the crossfire of the duel and spent the next few months with a disproportionately-sized head. He later confessed to Dumbledore that this confrontation caused his later productions to become as unlucky as the first. Soon after, he no longer wished to mount the performances due to the supposed bad luck which accompanied them and was replaced by Pomona Sprout.  Beery soon left Hogwarts, sometime before Dippet left in the years 1965 to 1971, to teach at the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts (W.A.D.A).[3]  Magical abilities and skills Herbology: Being the Professor of this subject at Hogwarts, Beery would have been highly accomplished and knowledgeable in this field, the study of magical and mundane plants and fungi.[3] Theatre: After having left Hogwarts, Beery went on to teach at the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts, showing he was also very proficient in the performing arts as well.[3] Etymology "Herbert" is derived from the Germanic elements hari "army" and beraht "bright". The Normans introduced this name to England, where it replaced an Old English cognate Herebeorht. In the course of the Middle Ages it became rare, but it was revived in the 19th century. The name "Herbert" may be a reference to the English word herb, referencing the subject he teaches.  Appearances The Tales of Beedle the Bard (First mentioned) Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Beery left Hogwarts before Dumbledore became Headmaster, an event which occurred between 1965 and 1971. As he was teaching at Hogwarts, he had to have turned 17 sometime before either of those dates - this places his latest date of birth between 1948 and 1954 inclusive, depending on his time of leaving Hogwarts to teach at W.A.D.A.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.00 3.01 3.02 3.03 3.04 3.05 3.06 3.07 3.08 3.09 3.10 3.11 The Tales of Beedle the Bard - "The Fountain of Fair Fortune"  ↑ As Albus Dumbledore was Headmaster at this time, and Beery left during Armando Dippet's tenure.
