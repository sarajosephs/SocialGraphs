At some point, she displayed signs of magical ability, acquired a wand and received instruction in the magical arts. As such was the case with almost every witch or wizard in Great Britain, she may have attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in her youth.[3]  Career At some point in or before to the 1870s, Eupraxia was named Headmistress of said institution by the Hogwarts Board of Governors, although it is unknown whether or not she ever held a teaching position at the school prior to her appointment.[4] In 1876, caretaker Rancorous Carpe devised an "elaborate trap" in an effort to remove Peeves, the resident Poltergeist, from the Castle, which failed. The Castle had to be evacuated for three days as Peeves amused himself by firing weapons randomly and threatening the students with death.[2] Professor Mole agreed to sign a contract with Peeves, so that he relinquished the weapons in exchange for additional privileges: a once-weekly swim in the boys' toilets on the ground floor, first refusal on stale bread from the kitchen for throwing purposes, as well as a new custom-made hat by Madame Bonhabille.[2] At some point during her career as Headmistress, it was also said that she had bewitched the Daedalian Keys in order to protect some cabinets somewhere at the school to prevent the contents from falling into the wrong hands.[5]  Magical abilities and skills Magical mastery: As the duly appointed headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and hence entrusted with the day-to-day operation of one of the most prestigious schools of magic in the world, as well as overseeing the tutelage of the students there, Professor Mole was a great witch in her own right. Transfiguration: When she enchanted the Daedalian Keys, she imbued them with the magical property of vanishing and reappearing every few years, which they continued to do following her departure from the school. As these were both highly advanced branches of Transfiguration, it stands to reason that she was very proficient in this branch of magic.[5] Charms: Professor Mole was said to have placed charms on the the Daedalian Keys to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands, implying that she was good with charms.[5] Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Hogwarts Legacy (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 Writing by J.
