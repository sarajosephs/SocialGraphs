I'm prefect Gabriel Truman, and I'm delighted to welcome you to HUFFLEPUFF HOUSE." — Gabriel Truman welcoming the Hufflepuff first-years in 1991[src]  Gabriel Truman (born c. 1975) was a wizard and a Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth. In the early 1990s, he was one of the school's Prefects, and dutifully welcomed Hufflepuff first-years to the Hufflepuff Basement with a short speech.

I should have got a week of detentions, but Professor Sprout let me off with a warning and a box of coconut ice." — Gabriel Truman.[src]  He began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry sometime between 1985 and 1987, where he was Sorted into Hufflepuff House.[2] In his third year, he landed in trouble by getting into a duel with a Ravenclaw prefect who argued that the famous Arithmancer Bridget Wenlock must have been in his own house, not Hufflepuff, as she was in fact. Gabriel felt he deserved a week's worth of detentions for his own actions, but Professor Sprout went easy on him, sending him off with a warning and a box of coconut ice.[2] By the 1991-1992 school year, Gabriel had been made a Prefect himself and, after the Start-of-Term Feast on 1 September, 1991, welcomed the Hufflepuff first-years as they arrived at Hufflepuff Basement with a short speech about the House traditions, symbols, characteristics, and famous past students.[2]  Behind the scenes    The "Hufflepuff Prefect" who might be Gabriel Truman in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4   In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, there is a playable character called "Hufflepuff Prefect" who is also male.[3] Although this character is never identified, he may be Gabriel.
