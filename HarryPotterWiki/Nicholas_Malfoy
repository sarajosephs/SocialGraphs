He is believed to have dispatched many Muggle tenants under the guise of the Black Death. If this is true, he escaped censure by the Wizards' Council, and thus was never punished for it.[1]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology The name Nicholas is a Greek name meaning "victory of the people." This could refer to the fact that after Malfoy killed many a Muggle, he was never punished. The name Malfoy comes from the French mal foi, meaning "bad faith." If Malfoy is anything like his descendants, then this name is fitting. Behind the scenes In 1992, Harry Potter, speaking about Draco Malfoy, said, "Look at his family... The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin, he's always boasting about it".[2] This indicates that Nicholas was most likely a Slytherin if he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, though it cannot be confirmed.
