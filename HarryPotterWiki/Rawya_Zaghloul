She likely attended Uagadou in her youth. At some point she became the Seeker for the Egyptian National Quidditch team for the 2002 Quidditch World Cup. Her team made it all the way to the final, alongside Bulgaria. During the match she famously beat Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum to the Snitch, leading to the Bulgarian National Quidditch team's defeat. This was a "crushing disappointment" for Bulgaria and, coupled with the team's loss of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup final, led to Viktor Krum's retirement.[1]  Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8  Pottermore - Quidditch World Cup 1990 - 2014 (Archived)              Categories         Categories:   20th century births    Egyptian individuals    Females    Seekers    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
