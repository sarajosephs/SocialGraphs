I'd like to think of myself as a modern-day Cupid, bringing couples together one cuppa at a time!" — Madam Puddifoot[src]  Madam Puddifoot (fl. 1980s[2]–2010)[3] was a British witch who ran Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop in Hogsmeade.[1]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Physical appearance 3 Personality and traits 4 Behind the scenes 5 Appearances 6 Notes and references   Biography     'Engorgio!'

Please help the Harry Potter Wiki by expanding this article to give more complete coverage of its subject.   In the 1980s, Puddifoot was introduced to Jacob's sibling by Bill Weasley and Nymphadora Tonks.[2]     Madam Puddifoot working in her shop   On Valentine's day in 1996, Puddifoot decorated her shop by placing several golden cherubs around and had them throw confetti over visiting couples every so often. She served coffee to the couple Harry Potter and Cho Chang.[1] By at least the 2010s, during the Calamity, volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force met with Madam Puddifoot to try to convince her to join the SOS Task Force officially. She enthusiastically agreed and informed all staff to do whatever necessary to help support the Ministry's efforts.[4]  Physical appearance Puddifoot was a very stout woman with brown eyes and a shiny black bun.[1]  Personality and traits  "My dear child, nothing in my shop is clutter! It's all deliberately setup to bring people together." — Madam Puddifoot to the unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student[src]  Puddifoot was quite lonely, which was why she cluttered a lot of stuff in her shop to create a warm environment and help bring people together. She enjoyed serving her customers to ease her of loneliness.[3]  Behind the scenes In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, Madam Puddifoot is depicted with blonde hair rather than black. She is not playable under normal circumstances, but may be temporarily controlled with the Imperius Curse in the level "Dumbledore's Army" in order to collect the Slytherin House Crest for that level.[5] It is possible she, alongside her fellow Hogsmeade residents, participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, as Horace Slughorn was recruiting them and Lord Voldemort declared a final stand for the entire Second Wizarding War.[6] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 8 images related to Puddifoot.
