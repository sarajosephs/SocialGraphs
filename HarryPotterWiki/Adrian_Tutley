Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography In recent times, Tutley attended the International Symposium of Animagi, and, considering himself one of the far more experienced attendees, was outraged when a team of fourteen-year old students from Uagadou School of Magic led an exhibition of synchronised transforming into animals such as elephants and cheetahs. Tutley even went on to lodge a formal complaint with the International Confederation of Wizards because of this.[1]  Magical abilities and skills Transfiguration: Tutley was exceptionally proficient with the art of Human Transfiguration, that he learned how to become an Animagus, allowing him to transform into a gerbil at will.
