'Beings' she declared, were those who could speak the human tongue. All those who could make themselves understood to Council members were therefore invited to join the next meeting. Once again, however, there were problems." — Newt Scamander regarding Elfrida Clagg's classification of a being[src] Chieftainess Elfrida Clagg (1612 - 1687) was a British witch and the Chieftainess of the Wizards' Council either in the fourteenth[4] or seventeenth century.[1] Either way, she was Burdock Muldoon's immediate successor of the post.[4] Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Early life 1.2 As Chieftainess of the Wizards' Council   2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Early life It is debated whether Clagg was born in 1612 or about one or two centuries earlier. She presumably attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in her youth, like so many other witches.  As Chieftainess of the Wizards' Council    Elfrida Clagg, as depicted in her Chocolate Frog Card   Clagg was Burdock Muldoon's successor on the post of Chief of the Wizards' Council. Madame Clagg attempted to redefine the classification of Beings and Beasts by declaring that all those magical creatures that could speak the human tongue were Beings. However, this once more caused problems with the beings meeting as the Trolls were again classified as Beings and destroyed the meeting chamber, Jarveys were in attendance and tore as many Council members' ankles as they could, and the Centaurs boycotted the meeting as the Merpeople were not invited. A large delegation of ghosts also attended, but left in disgust of what they later called "the Council's unashamed emphasis on the needs of the living as opposed to the wishes of the dead".[4] Also, due to the declining numbers of Golden Snidgets, Clagg made them a protected species, and outlawed both their hunting, and their use in Quidditch matches. She founded the Modesty Rabnott Snidget Reservation in Somerset, England, named in honour of Modesty Rabnott's early efforts at protecting Snidgets.[5]  Etymology "Elfrida" is from the Old English name Ælfþryð meaning "elf strength" from the element ælf combined with þryð "strength". Ælfþryð was a 10th-century queen of England. This name was rare after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 19th century.  Behind the scenes In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, a portrait of a witch called "Elfrida Cragg" is said to be stationed in the British Ministry of Magic Headquarters.[6] It is possible that this individual's name is a misspelling of Elfrida Clagg.
