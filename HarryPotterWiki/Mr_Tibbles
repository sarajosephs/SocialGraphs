The name is deriving from the Old High German first name Dietbald which means "people" + "bold". "Tibbles" and the variant "Tibby" became popular cat names in the Middle Ages due to popularity of the cat Tibert in the Reynard the Fox stories. The character Tybalt in Romeo and Juliet was named after Tibert and is mocked in the play as "the Prince of Cats".
