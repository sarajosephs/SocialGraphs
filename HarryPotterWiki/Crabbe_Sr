Thirteen years it's been, and yet, here you stand as if it were only yesterday. We are still united under the Dark Mark then! Or are we?" — Voldemort viciously greeting his Death Eaters in the Little Hangleton graveyard[src]  Mr Crabbe was a British Pure-blood Dark Wizard, a Death Eater, and the father of Vincent Crabbe.

He was possibly related to Irma Crabbe, wife of Pollux Black.  First Wizarding War Crabbe was a Death Eater during the First Wizarding War and was loyal to his master up until his downfall. In the aftermath, Crabbe was inaccurately acquitted of being a Death Eater by the British Ministry of Magic.[4] Around the downfall of Voldemort, Crabbe and his wife had a baby boy, Vincent Crabbe, who would be educated at Hogwarts from 1991-1998, and he became friends with Gregory Goyle and Draco Malfoy.  Second Wizarding War  "We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary..." — Lucius Malfoy gives orders to the group of Death Eaters[src] Crabbe was one of the few Death Eaters who returned to Lord Voldemort when he rose to power again in 1995. Voldemort was displeased when he learned that Crabbe didn't attempt to find him, but he forgave him.[5] During the Second Wizarding War, Crabbe participated in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996, and was paired with Rabastan Lestrange during the pursuit of the six D.A. members. He went with Lestrange to try and capture Harry, Hermione, and Neville, who were hiding in the Time Room.[6] He was likely imprisoned in Azkaban, but re-escaped in 1997. During the Battle of Hogwarts the following year, Crabbe's son Vincent (who had also become a Dark Wizard) died by the effects of his own Fiendfyre curse.[7] Crabbe's reaction over his son's death is unknown if he was even aware of it at all. Crabbe likely fought at the Battle of Hogwarts as well, although his presence in this battle is unconfirmed.  Post-war Crabbe was presumably killed or imprisoned in Azkaban after Voldemort's final death and defeat.  Physical appearance Much like his son, Crabbe was a large muscular man, and spoke with a dull voice.  Personality and traits He appeared to be rather unintelligent and slow-witted, but he was cunning enough to avoid Azkaban after his master's first downfall. Though he bowed sycophantically before Voldemort, his loyalty was highly questionable as he did not attempt to find his master when he disappeared.[5] Like most Death Eaters, he was very sadistic and bloodthirsty, as he was willing to use the Killing Curse on Hermione Granger who was a teenager, during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries,[6] showing he had no qualms about harming innocents.  Magical abilities and skills Dark Arts: Being a Death Eater, Crabbe was highly proficient in dark magic, including with the casting of the Unforgivable Curses and other dark charms. He was confident of his ability to murder Hermione Granger with the Killing Curse in 1996, a curse which requires much skill and malice to cast successfully.[6] Duelling: Being a Death Eater, Crabbe would have been highly trained in Martial magic and therefore a reasonably competent duellist, and likely participated in many battles during the First Wizarding War. He later participated in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, where he fought against Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix.[6] Apparition: Crabbe was accomplished in apparition, as he was able to apparate to the Little Hangleton graveyard to witness the return of his master in 1995.[5] Behind the scenes It is not specified if Crabbe attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Crabbe was played by Paschal Friel. It's likely that he was the Death Eater whose head turned into that of a baby during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. This essay[8] states that either he or Rabastan Lestrange were the most likely Death Eaters in the Time Room. Though not identified, this Death Eater was large and had black hair (descriptions that apply to his son, Vincent Crabbe) and was not recognised by Harry Potter. As his partner Rabastan Lestrange's appearance was known by Harry, he likely would've been identified.

J.K. Rowling: Yes, because a Patronus is used against things that the Death Eaters generally generate, or fight alongside. They would not need Patronuses.”  ↑ Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 4 (Horace Slughorn) - Horace Slughorn: You'll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families.
