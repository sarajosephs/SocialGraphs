She either was home schooled by her parents or attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which she would have attended from 1899 or 1900 to 1906 or 1907. In her adult life, she began writing her famous book collection, titled the Enchanted Encounters.[1]  Death and post-mortem LaFolle died in 1971 at the age of 82 or 83. She was on a Chocolate Frog Card after her death and was awarded 'Wizard of the Month' in 2005.[1]  Behind the scenes Fifi LaFolle was Wizard of the Month on J. K. Rowling's official site for October 2005. The image accompanying her entry on the website appears to be based on the deceased British romance novelist Barbara Cartland. In French, 'La Folle' means 'the mad woman'. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 2 images related to Fifi LaFolle. J. K.
