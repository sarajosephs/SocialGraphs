Gunhilda de Gorsemoor   Biographical information  Born 1556[1]   Died 1639 (aged 82-83)[1]   Also known as The One-Eyed Witch[2]    Physical information  Species Human   Gender Female   Hair colour Red (formerly)Grey (formerly)Bald   Eye colour Green[1]   Skin colour White[1]    Affiliation  Occupation Healer[1]   [Source]  Gunhilda de Gorsemoor (1556 – 1639) was a one-eyed, hump-backed witch and Healer who discovered a cure for Dragon Pox.[1]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Early life 1.2 As a Healer 1.3 Death and legacy   2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 See also 5 Appearances 6 Notes and references   Biography Early life Not much is known about Gunhilda de Gorsemoor's early life. She was born in 1556.[1] Gunhilda shared her name with Gunhilda Kneen, an eleventh-century witch who came down with a "touch" of Dragon Pox, and as a result couldn't play in a Quidditch match.[3]  As a Healer    Gunhilda treating a sick boy   At some point in her life, Gunhilda became a Healer. She was seen as a talented and hard-working Healer by everyone who knew her. As a gifted potioneer, Gunhilda became very famous for her development of the cure for dragon pox, a disease that in worst cases killed many wizards, including Chauncey Oldridge[1] and, more recently, Abraxas Malfoy.[4] Although effective, Gunhilda's cure had not eradicated the disease.[5]  Death and legacy    This statue of Gunhilda could be found in Hogwarts Castle   After her death in 1639, everyone who knew her felt great sorrow. The great Healer might have died but she was not forgotten; her cure for Dragon Pox continued saving lives many centuries after her death. For this, Gunhilda was featured in a Chocolate Frog Card.[1] A statue of Gunhilda could be found in the Gunhilda of Gorsemoor Corridor on the third-floor at Hogwarts Castle. When one tapped the statue's hump with a wand and casted the opening charm Dissendium, a secret passage would be opened, leading to the basement of Honeydukes Sweetshop in Hogsmeade, which was used by Harry Potter in the 1993–1994 school year[2] and a group of students in the 2009–2010 school year.[6]  Magical abilities and skills Healing magic: Gunhilda was a gifted Healer, as she famously invented a Dragon pox cure, showing her expertise in the art of medical magic.[1] Potions: Gunhilda was also a highly talented Potioneer, as she created the Dragon pox cure, a healing potion which worked as the cure for the often lethal disease Dragon Pox.[1] Etymology The name "Gunhilda" is from the Old Norse name Gunnhildr, derived from the elements gunnr "war" and hildr "battle".
