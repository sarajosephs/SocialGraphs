Mrs Roberts   Biographical information  Blood status Muggle   Marital status Married   Nationality British    Physical information  Species Human   Gender Female    Relationship information  Family members Mr Roberts (husband)Two children    Affiliation  Loyalty Roberts family   [Source]  Mrs Roberts was the wife of the Muggle man who managed the campground near to where the Quidditch World Cup was held in 1994.  Biography She had two children with Mr Roberts, including at least one son, who was her youngest child. The family lived together in a stone cottage at the front of the campsite.[1] The Roberts family were attacked by Death Eaters the night after the Quidditch match. One of the Dark Wizards flipped Mrs Roberts upside down in mid-air, making her nightdress fall down, and revealing her "voluminous" drawers to everyone. The other Death Eaters laughed as she struggled to cover herself. She was not seriously injured during the incident.[2] Mrs Roberts' memory was altered to forget the incident, as was her husband's.[3]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 7 (Bagman and Crouch)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 9 (The Dark Mark)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 10 (Mayhem at the Ministry)              Categories         Categories:   British individuals    Females    Married individuals    Muggles    Parents    Roberts family    Unnamed family members    Victims of Muggle torture             Languages      Français Polski Português do Brasil      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
