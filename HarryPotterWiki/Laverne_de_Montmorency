Most of the greatest wizarding inventors and innovators were in our house, including... Laverne de Montmorency, a great pioneer of love potions...." — Robert Hilliard[src]  Laverne de Montmorency (1823 – 1893) was a nineteenth-century potioneer, who invented a number of love potions. She appears on a Chocolate Frog Card.[3]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 Behind the scenes 5 Appearances 6 Notes and references   Biography Laverne de Montmorency was born in 1823, somewhere in the British Isles.[3] In her youth, she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from around 1834-1841, and was Sorted into Ravenclaw.[2] After her graduation from Hogwarts School, Laverne de Montmorency presumably studied further into Potion-making, becoming an accomplished potioneer and an expert in love potions. She became famous for her invention of many such potions.[3] Ms. de Montmorency died in 1893, aged around 70. In her honour, her invention of many love potions was recorded on a Chocolate Frog Card. On 1 September, 1991, Prefect Robert Hilliard welcomed the Ravenclaw first years to Ravenclaw Tower with a short speech, in which he mentioned potioneer Laverne de Montmorency as one of the many notable Hogwarts students, who had been Sorted, like them, into Ravenclaw.[2]  Magical abilities and skills Potions: Laverne was a highly accomplished professional Potioneer and was thus highly proficient in the art and science of potion-making, having successfully invented a number of Love Potions in her lifetime. Given how Love Potions are particularly advanced brews, and that she was even featured on a Chocolate Frog Card for her impressive achievements, this shows her great level of expertise and talent in this branch of magic. Etymology "Laverne" is derived from a French place-name that includes the Gaulish word vern, meaning "alder." It is sometimes associated with Laverna, the Roman goddess of thieves, or the Latin adjective vernus, meaning "of spring."[4] The House of Montmorency was one of the oldest and most distinguished noble families in France. Montmorency was also the name of the family's fiefdom. The Montmorency cherry is a popular variety of sour cherries, cultivated in the United States. Behind the scenes Despite this individual's Hag-like appearance in her Chocolate Frog Card picture, she was actually a human witch.
