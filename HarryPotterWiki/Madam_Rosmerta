After being placed under the curse, she helped Malfoy against her will to smuggle cursed items into Hogwarts Castle.[6][7] It is likely she later redeemed herself by fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts.

Never saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here — ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!" — Rosmerta mentions that she was a barmaid [src] Rosmerta was older than the Marauders, as she was the barmaid whilst they were all still at school. Rosmerta lived in and was the barmaid of the Three Broomsticks during the First Wizarding War; she was a listener of gossip and believed the rumours that Sirius Black had turned his friends, the Potter family, over to Lord Voldemort to be true when news broke out they had been murdered and that the war was over.[2] It remains unknown how she reacted when the true story was told to her, (that it was Peter Pettigrew who betrayed the Potters) or, indeed, if she ever found out. She continued to tend bar during the 1980s.  1986–1987 school year    Madam Rosmerta meeting Jacob's sibling for the first time   During 1986, Rosmerta was introduced to Jacob's sibling by Rubeus Hagrid in the Three Broomsticks during the student's first outing to Hogsmeade. They requested for information regarding their brother and his search for the Cursed Vaults from Rosmerta, in which they learnt from her recount that Jacob had Transfigured a secret notebook of his into a Black Quill, the whereabouts of which were unknown then. Jacob's sibling beseeched Rosmerta to find it for them, promising to do anything for her in return, an offer she promptly accepted.[8] While she was preoccupied in searching for the Black Quill in the pub's back room, Jacob's sibling proceeded to help her out by serving her customers their orders, an activity they found moderatly easy, with the exception of them having nearly dropped a mug of Butterbeer that was Tranfigured into a mongoose by the timely intervention of a helpful wizard. Acknowledging that her search for the desired quill would take longer, Rosmerta requested that Jacob's sibling help her concoct an extra-sweet brew of Butterbeer by fetching its various ingredients from the Hogwarts Castle for her. By the time they had managed to fulfil her request and returned back to the Three Broomsticks, Rosmerta had managed to successfully retrieve the Black Quill, which she then gave to Jacob's sibling.[8] Later during the year, she retrieved some vintage Butterbeer 1707 for Bilton Bilmes upon Jacob's sibling's request from the back rooms of the inn, while they managed the customers for her.[9]  1987–1988 school year Rosmerta was interrogated by Patricia Rakepick regarding the possible whereabouts of Jacob's notebook and map. She claimed to know nothing and threatened to inform some of her best customers from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement regarding Rakepick's behaviour, which made the Curse-Breaker back down quickly. Rosmerta than sarcastically gave her farewell and told her not to return to her establishment again.[3]  1989–1990 school year  "Madam Rosmerta only lets me use plastic glasses after breaking her fifteenth glass mug." — Nymphadora Tonks[src]  Towards the end of this school year, Rosmerta was present at a party held at the inn by various Hogwarts staff and students, which the Weird Sisters also performed at.[10]  1990–1991 school year During this school year, Rosmerta gave Jacob's sibling and Nymphadora Tonks the permission to use her fireplace in the inn to access the British Ministry of Magic via the Floo Network.[11] Much later, she served Jacob's sibling and their father Peregrine when the two came to the Three Broomsticks for a personal dinner. However, she ended up dropping the two mugs of Butterbeer Peregrine ordered when he told her to stop listening in on their private conversation.[12]  1993–1994 school year    Rosmerta, Cornelius Fudge, and Minerva McGonagall meeting outside her pub   In 1993, Madam Rosmerta was angered when Dementors were in Hogsmeade to catch Sirius Black because their presence was scaring away many of her customers, not least when they searched her pub twice. She hosted an informal meeting between Minerva McGonagall, Cornelius Fudge, Filius Flitwick, and Rubeus Hagrid discussing Sirius Black and his friends. They discussed how Sirius Black had been named Harry Potter's godfather before the Potters' demise.[2]  1996–1997 school year  "There's one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though. Madam Rosmerta's under the Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters, that's how the necklace and the poisoned mead —" — Harry regarding Rosmerta being under the Imperius Curse[src]      Rosmerta talking with Fudge and McGonagall   In 1997, it emerged that Rosmerta had become an unwilling agent of the Death Eaters. In order to fulfil his mission to assassinate Albus Dumbledore, Draco Malfoy had managed to place Rosmerta under the Imperius Curse. He used her to pass on a cursed Opal Necklace to Hogwarts student Katie Bell, who accidentally touched the necklace and was subjected to the very harmful curse intended for the Headmaster.[6] Rosmerta also poisoned mead that was intended to be given to Dumbledore through Horace Slughorn in the guise as a Christmas present, but it was unintentionally drunk by Ron Weasley, who was saved by Harry Potter; Harry had shoved a Bezoar down Ron's throat to save his life.[13] Malfoy communicated with Rosmerta through fake galleons, copying the idea from 'the Mudblood Granger' and Dumbledore's Army.[7] Argus Filch did not suspect anything provided by Rosmerta, hence allowing the poisoned mead to sneak past security.[7] After Harry and Dumbledore had been to the cave to retrieve a locket, they believed to be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, they apparated to Hogsmeade, where Madam Rosmerta alerted them to the presence of the Dark Mark above the school and gave them brooms on which they could travel rapidly back to Hogwarts, where Draco's plan could be brought to completion.[7] Harry Potter eventually cleared her name as he felt that that investigation on Albus Dumbledore's death may link to her.[14]  1998  "They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries." — Reinforcements arriving during the Battle of Hogwarts[src]  It is unknown if Rosmerta was part of the reinforcements from Hogsmeade during the Battle of Hogwarts or if she participated in the war. This battle resulted in the end of the Second Wizarding War.  2010s During the Calamity, Rosmerta instructed a panel of Magizoologists on a basic Revive Charm.[15]  Physical appearance     Madam Rosmerta as a middle-aged women    Hermione Granger: "Ron, what are you looking at?" Ron Weasley: "Nothing" Hermione Granger: "I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky" — Ron trying to catch Madam Rosmerta's eye[src]  Rosmerta was an attractive woman, described as "a curvy sort of woman with a pretty face". On one occasion, she was seen wearing glittery open-toed high-heels. Several Hogwarts pupils, including Ron Weasley, have fancied her.[2][6]  Magical abilities and skills Charms: Rosmerta was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal Patronus,[4][5] a highly advanced form of magic. Etymology Rosmerta was the Romano-Celtic goddess of fertility and abundance, known as the "Great Provider". In Latin, it means "good purveyor" or "great provider".  Behind the scenes     Rosmerta as seen in Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells   Madam Rosmerta was portrayed by British actress Julie Christie in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. She only appears twice in the film; once at the Three Broomsticks and again, on close observation, when Harry and Hermione go back in time. Her role was reduced to this film alone as she did not appear in any of the subsequent film adaptations of the novels. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 28 images related to Rosmerta.
