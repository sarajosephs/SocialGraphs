Possessions Wand: His wand was made out of applewood, a fact which may have been connected to his skill with language, as apple wands were reputed to be common among witches and wizards with a special talent for speaking to magical beings in their own tongues.[1] Behind the scenes It is possible that Marwood studied at Merge School of Under-Water Spellage in the Red Sea in order to prepare for underwater expeditions to study the ways of the merpeople.
