Together with Ritchie Coote, he replaced Jack Sloper and Andrew Kirke.[3]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Hogwarts years  1.1.1 Early years 1.1.2 Third year 1.1.3 Fourth year 1.1.4 Battle of Hogwarts     2 Physical description 3 Magical abilities and skills 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Hogwarts years Early years Jimmy started his education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1994. Upon his arrival at Hogwarts, Jimmy was sorted into Gryffindor House, a house renowned for bravery. He was three years below the famous Harry Potter.  Third year  "Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry's head with a ferociously hit Bludger..." — Harry Potter's assessment of the new Gryffindor Beaters[src]  In the 1996–1997 school year Jimmy tried out and became the new Beater for Gryffindor in the 1996-1997 Quidditch season replacing Fred and George Weasley with Ritchie Coote. Neither of them gave the team the same charisma, but were almost as good in game. During tryouts Jimmy caused Harry to receive a swelling on his head the size of an egg after hitting him with a Bludger.[3] During the Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff match it was mentioned by Hermione Granger that he and Ritchie Coote apparently caught Harry after he was knocked out by a Bludger to the head that Cormac McLaggen accidentally hit to him.[4]  Fourth year After the death of former Headmaster Dumbledore, Snape took to the position of Head. The school was corrupt and being ran by Lord Voldemort indirectly with puppet teachers and Death Eaters Amycus Carrow and Alecto Carrow being employed this year. Attendance to Hogwarts was compulsory for all Pure-blood and Half-blood students.  Battle of Hogwarts  "Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!" — McGonagall ordering Peakes to leave the school[src]    Students fleeing Hogwarts castle as it falls under attack   When Hogwarts fell under attack from Death Eaters in 1998, Peakes was one of the students, along with Colin Creevey that had to be forcibly pushed out of the Great Hall by Minerva McGonagall as he wanted to stay and fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, but was too young.[5] It is unknown whether or not Peakes sneaked back into the castle to fight but his friend who was also made to leave, Colin, did sneak back into the castle to fight and was subsequently killed.  Physical description Peakes was described to be short but broad-chested. Peakes did not have the "old brilliance" of Fred and George Weasley (whom he and fellow new Beater Ritchie Coote replaced), but during the tryouts, he was strong enough to hit a Bludger hard enough to cause a lump about the size of an egg on Harry's head.[3]  Magical abilities and skills Flying: Having been chosen as a Beater for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Peakes was a skilled broomstick flyer and Quidditch player.[3] Appearances Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (First appearance) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Notes and references   ↑ He was able to attend Hogwarts during the 1997–1998 school year, when Muggle-born students could not, which means he was of wizarding ancestry.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.00 3.01 3.02 3.03 3.04 3.05 3.06 3.07 3.08 3.09 3.10 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 11 (Hermione's Helping Hand)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 20 (Lord Voldemort's Request)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 31 (The Battle of Hogwarts)     Quidditch positions at Hogwarts      Captains   Filemina Alchin · Astrix Alixan · Orion Amari · Angelina Appleby · Oona Ballington · Concepta Battista · Hugh Biggs · Richard Carter · Angelica Cole · Stuart Craggy · Winky Crockett · Roger Davies · Cedric Diggory · Marcus Flint · Hamish Frater · Stephen Gould · David Hamblin · Natalie Holkham · Jody Jacknife · Angelina Johnson · Jo King · Neil Lament · Steve Laughalot · Graham Montague · Mark Overcliff · Erika Rath · Andrew Snowy Owl · Harry Potter · Isobel Ross · Ashley Sanders · Lucinda Talkalot · Urquhart · Emma Vanity · Charlie Weasley · Rufus Winickus · Oliver Wood · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (I) · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (II)   Keepers   Kevin Bletchley · Miles Bletchley · Brennan Doyle · Andre Egwu · Herbert Fleet · Geoffrey Hooper · Cormac McLaggen · Grant Page · Ron Weasley · Oliver Wood · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Gryffindor Keeper · Unidentified Slytherin Keeper · Unidentified Keeper (I) · Unidentified Keeper (II) · Unidentified Keeper (III)   Chasers   Orion Amari · Tamsin Applebee · Katie Bell · Bradley · Randolph Burrow · Cadwallader · Chambers · Roger Davies · Eekins · Marcus Flint · Rose Granger-Weasley · Jarrett · Angelina Johnson · Heidi Macavoy · Graham Montague · Ethan Parkin · Skye Parkin · James Potter · Malcolm Preece · Adrian Pucey · Demelza Robins · Zacharias Smith · Alicia Spinnet · Jeremy Stretton · Dean Thomas · Urquhart · Vaisey · Cassius Warrington · Ginny Weasley · Blaise Zabini · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Chaser (I) · Unidentified Chaser (II) · Unidentified fourth-year Chaser · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (I) · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (II) · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (III) · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (IV) · Erika Rath's friend (I) · Erika Rath's friend (II) · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (I)   Beaters   Bean · Lucian Bole · Ritchie Coote · Vincent Crabbe · Peregrine Derrick · Dobbin · Gregory Goyle · Duncan Inglebee · Andrew Kirke · Michael McManus · Maxine O'Flaherty · Jimmy Peakes · Erika Rath · Anthony Rickett · Jason Samuels · Jack Sloper · Fred Weasley · George Weasley · Baglan Wellnelly · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Beater · Unidentified Gryffindor beater · Unidentified Slytherin Beater (I) · Unidentified Slytherin Beater (II) · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (II)   Seekers   Regulus Black · Cho Chang · Cedric Diggory · Andre Egwu · Harper · Terence Higgs · Gilderoy Lockhart · Draco Malfoy · Harry Potter · Summerby · Charlie Weasley · Ginny Weasley · Gruffyd Wellnelly · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Gryffindor seeker · Unidentified Hufflepuff Seeker · Unidentified Ravenclaw Seeker · Unidentified Ravenclaw Seeker's substitute · Unidentified Seeker (I) · Unidentified Seeker (II)   Unknown positions   Vicky Bishopper · Robin Higgy · R.
