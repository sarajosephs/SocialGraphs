She was once engaged to a wizard who worked in the Improper Use of Magic Office, but broke off her engagement to him, claiming that he had a "hairy heart" (a wizarding expression for a person who is unfeeling). Rumour had it that her real reason for ending the engagement was catching her fiancé fondling some Horklumps.[1]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology Honoria is a feminine form of the late Roman name Honorius, meaning "honour". Some early saints and popes and one king held this name.  Behind the scenes It is unknown whether Honoria was the sister of Percival Dumbledore or his wife Kendra. In the simplified Chinese translation of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, the translation of "aunt" used (姑妈) refers to the father's elder sister,[3] but this remains unconfirmed by J. K. Rowling.[4] Given that she's Credence Barebone's great-aunt, it is possible that Honoria is the aunt who took Credence to America.
