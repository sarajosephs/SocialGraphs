His youngest child was a boy.[1] Mr Roberts believed that his wizarding guests were confused with Muggle money because they were all from out of the country; one even tried to pay him with a galleon.[1]   "At that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr Roberts's front door. 'Obliviate!' he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr Roberts." — An Obliviator apparating and obliviating Roberts[src]  Ministry of Magic employees were required to perform Memory Charms on him several times a day.[1]     Roberts and his family being levitated into the air by Death Eaters during the riot   The night after the Quidditch match, Mr Roberts, his wife, and their two children were all abducted by Death Eaters, who proceeded to levitate them through the air, and, like puppeteers controlling four marionettes with invisible strings, contorted the defenceless family into grotesque shapes and span them around mid-air as means to humiliate and frighten them.[2] When Arthur Weasley and his party were leaving the campsite the following morning, Mr Roberts wished them a Merry Christmas, although it was the middle of summer. Mr Weasley explained that Mr Roberts had been left temporarily disoriented by the Memory Charm that had been used to erase his memories of the Death Eater attack.[3]  Behind the scenes The Robertses did not make it to the final cut of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. A brief shot of them being tortured by Death Eaters during the Quidditch World Cup riot can be seen, however, in the film's official trailer.
