Arthur Weasley was talking to her, and, judging from his reaction, she had just tried to convince him to become involved in something with which he had reservations.[2]  Physical appearance She wore her blonde hair in a high style that resembled an anthill.[1]  Etymology The name Wakanda means "inner magical power" in Sioux[4]. In Sioux tradition, Wakanda or Wakan Tanka is also a term for that which is sacred or divine. Behind the scenes In a deleted scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, she is portrayed by Harriet Thorpe who has recently taken over the role of Tanya in Mamma Mia! on the West End.[5] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 1 image related to Wakanda. ﻿Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (First appearance) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (Appears in deleted scene(s)) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 13 (The Muggle-Born Registration Commission) - "an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill. “...
