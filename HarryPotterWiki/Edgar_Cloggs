Edgar Cloggs   Biographical information  Born No later than 1880[1]   Died Before 1892[2]    Physical information  Species Human (formerly)[3]Ghost[3]   Gender Male[3]    Affiliation  Occupation Quidditch player[3]   Loyalty Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[3]   [Source]  Edgar Cloggs was the ghost of a wizard who was often found hanging around the Quidditch pitch at Hogwarts for as long as anyone could remember.[3] He was willing to help the Hogwarts Quidditch teams to practise.[3] By the year of 1993, he was also included on a Chocolate Frog Card, for his achievements in the sport.[4]  Contents  1 Magical abilities and skills 2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Magical abilities and skills Flying: Edgar was said to have been an extremely proficient Quidditch player in his day, and he still possessed the ability to fly masterfully on a broom as a ghost while teaching Quidditch practise to Hogwarts students.[3] Etymology Derived from the Old English elements ead "rich, blessed" and gar "spear". This was the name of a 10th century English king who is regarded as a saint. The name did not survive long after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 18th century, in part due to a character by this name in Sir Walter Scott's novel 'The Bride of Lammermoor' (1819). Famous bearers include author and poet Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), French impressionist painter Edgar Degas (1834-1917), and author Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950).  Behind the scenes Cloggs bears a surprising resemblance to Badger Picklish III from Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, another Quidditch-related ghost.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card) Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup (First appearance) Harry Potter: Wizards Unite (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Harry states that he is "the youngest seeker in a century". If this statement is supposed to be taken literally, Edgar Cloggs cannot be younger than 12 at the time he died, as he was dead by 1892 and was already playing Quidditch.  ↑ Taking "as long as anyone can remember" at face value, he would have been haunting the Quidditch Pitch since the oldest known living person at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore, began studying there.  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup  ↑ Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)              Categories         Categories:   British individuals    Chocolate Frog Cards    Ghosts    Historical figures    Males    Quidditch players    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
