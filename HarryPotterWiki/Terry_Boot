Hermione Granger: "Yes." Terry Boot: "But that's... that's N.E.W.T. standard, that is." Hermione Granger: "Oh. Oh... well... yes, I suppose it is...." — Terry being impressed with Hermione's ability to perform N.E.W.T. level magic[src]  Terry Boot (b. 1979 or 1980) was a wizard and Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Harry Potter's year.[4] He became friends with housemates Michael Corner and Anthony Goldstein. In his fifth year, Terry joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. On 2 May 1998, he fought in the Battle of Hogwarts alongside the other defenders of Hogwarts. It can be assumed that Terry survived the final battle, as he was not mentioned among the Fallen Fifty.

Terry could likely be a descendant of Webster Boot, the adopted son of Ilvermorny founders James Steward (a No-Maj, or Muggle) and Isolt Sayre (a Pure-blood and descendant of Salazar Slytherin).[8]  Hogwarts years (1991-1998) Early years  "Pinch it hard, it will stop bleeding in a second, Boot." — Lockhart during the Duelling Club chaos[src]     The 1991 Sorting Ceremony in which Terry was Sorted into Ravenclaw   In 1991, Terry started his education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Upon his arrival during the Sorting Ceremony, the Sorting Hat placed Terry in Ravenclaw House.[4] Terry was sorted into Ravenclaw with students Padma Patil, Michael Corner, and Anthony Goldstein, with whom he became friends.      Terry, behind Ron Weasley, walking to the Ravenclaw Common Room   In his second year at Hogwarts, the school was under threat of closure after the Chamber of Secrets had been opened. As a precaution to protect students from any possible danger, a Duelling Club started up, instructed by Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. During one practice, chaos broke out and Lockhart had to tend to several students. Terry had received an injury and Lockhart told him to pinch his wound hard to stop the bleeding.[6] In his fourth year, Terry visited Professor Dumbledore's office for unknown reasons and took interest in the Sword of Gryffindor, with one of the portraits informing him that Harry Potter had used it to kill a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets.[7]  Fifth year  Terry: "Did you kill a basilisk with the sword from Dumbledore's office?" Harry Potter: "Yes, but we're learning how to use spells, not swords!" Terry: "Oh, okay. I dunno if Michael or Anthony know where you meet. You'd better tell them; I'll see you later." — Terry asking Harry about his second year[src]  In Terry's fifth year of education, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was put under the eyes of the Ministry of Magic. Dolores Jane Umbridge was stationed at Hogwarts as a spy due to events that took place the previous year, in addition to being Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Umbridge caused an uproar amongst the students since she refused to teach defensive spells, despite it being said that Lord Voldemort was at large once again.      Terry Joins Dumbledore's Army   Hermione Granger felt she ought to do something about the lack of a proper defence education. Hermione then founded an organisation called Dumbledore's Army, where students learned how to defend themselves and fight in combat. This organisation was taught and led by Harry Potter, who has had numerous experience fighting off Dark Wizards. Terry attended the first meeting of the D.A., which took place in the Hog's Head. When people began to mention Harry's spectacular feats, Terry mentioned that Harry had slayed a Basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor in Dumbledore's office. This accomplishment amazed most of the students present, with only a few exceptions.[7]      Terry Boot talking with Harry and Hermione about Umbridge   During one D.A. meeting, Terry seemed very impressed that Hermione was able to perform a Protean Charm on the enchanted Dumbledore's Army coins, a N.E.W.T.-level spell. He also commented that she should haven been a Ravenclaw. These coins were used as methods of communication between members of the D.A.[9] At the end of the school year, after Harry and some other members of the D.A. fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, it was finally revealed that Lucius Malfoy was a Death Eater. His son Draco Malfoy was displeased that this had become public and that his father had been put in Azkaban. Terry was one of the D.A. members to come to the assistance of Harry when Draco, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, attempted to attack him on the Hogwarts Express journey home. Terry and his friends performed a variety of jinxes and hexes that left the three looking like large slugs in their school robes.[10]  Sixth year  Terry Boot: "Why don’t people drink it all the time, sir?" Horace Slughorn: "Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence. Too much of a good thing, you know... highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally..." — Terry boot asking Professor Horace Slughorn about the Felix Felicis potion in Potions class[src]      Terry in N.E.W.T.-level potions   During his sixth year, the Second Wizarding War had officially been declared. The school was put under the protection of Aurors. Terry was one of only twelve students able to advance to N.E.W.T.-level Potions class. He was one of four Ravenclaws to do so.[11] There was also four Slytherins, three Gryffindors, and one Hufflepuff in the N.E.W.T-level class. This indicates that the Potions O.W.L. exam was difficult.       Terry participated the Apparition lessons provided by the school   This year students would learn how to Apparate for the first time. At the end of his sixth year, Severus Snape killed headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and Minerva McGonagall was made acting headmistress until Terry's seventh year, when Severus Snape was put in charge. Terry attended Dumbledore's funeral with his classmates.  Seventh year  "Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a Dragon? It's everywhere, everyone's talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten up by the Carrows for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!" — Neville Longbottom questioning the trio[src]     D.A. members welcome Harry back in 1998   During his seventh year, Terry joined the revived Dumbledore's Army to oppose the Carrow professors' cruel reign over Hogwarts while Lord Voldemort controlled the Ministry of Magic. When rumours surfaced that Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley broke into Gringotts Wizarding Bank and escaped on a dragon. Terry shouted an announcement about it during dinner in the Great Hall, and was consequently physically punished by the Carrows.   Battle of Hogwarts He later provided Harry with some information about Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem.[12] He also fought in the Battle of Hogwarts.  Later life (post 1998) Since Terry was not listed among the casualties, it can be presumed he survived the Second Wizarding War. If he did indeed survive, his later life is unknown.  Magical abilities and skills Potions: Terry was very skilled at potion-making since he was one of four Ravenclaws in 1996 to advance to N.E.W.T.-level.[11] He must have earned either an 'Outstanding' or an 'Exceeds Expectations' on his O.W.L. exam in order for him to progress to such an advanced class. Defence Against the Dark Arts: Terry was a devoted member of the D.A., so he must have mastered numerous offensive and defensive spells under the masterful instruction of Harry Potter.[5] Duelling: Terry participated in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, showing he had some skill in duelling. He was also capable of casting an unknown dark charm which made Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle resemble slugs in 1996.[10] Etymology "Terry" is a form of Terence, which means "tender, or gracious". "Boot" is a surname referring to a place called Boot, near Ravenglass in Cumbria. Behind the scenes In Harry Potter and Me, Terry was named Trevor Boot. Later, Neville Longbottom's toad was named so. He is also marked as a Muggle-born, though this is likely not canon, considering that Terry attended his seventh year at Hogwarts, when Muggle-borns were being rounded up by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. Terry was played by Kevin Lee Yi in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and voiced by Andrew Edmeads in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Terry is omitted from the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, however, one of Terry's lines is instead spoken by Neville Longbottom. Terry was omitted from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, instead, Cho Chang says about Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem being lost for lots of centuries. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 10 images related to Terry Boot. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (First appearance) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Name appears on parchment) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup Harry Potter and Me (Mentioned only) Pottermore Wizarding World Notes and references   ↑ In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 21 (The Unknowable Room), Terry didn't have to attend a Potions lesson on 21 April, 1997, because he was seventeen and could take his Apparition test.  ↑ In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 29 (The Lost Diadem), Terry was hiding out in the Room of Requirement with Dumbledore's Army before the members Neville summoned from outside the school began to arrive. This means he attended Hogwarts during the 1997-1998 school year, and must have been either half-blood or pure-blood, as Muggle-borns were banned from the school under the Voldemort regime. As well as this, it is likely that he is descended from Webster Boot and thus is unlikely to be Muggle-born. However, his blood status is given as Muggle-born on the student list shown by J. K. Rowling on Harry Potter and Me.   ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 7 (The Sorting Hat)  ↑ 5.0 5.1 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 18 (Dumbledore's Army)  ↑ 6.0 6.1 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 11 (The Duelling Club)  ↑ 7.0 7.1 7.2 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 16 (In The Hog's Head)  ↑ Writing by J.
