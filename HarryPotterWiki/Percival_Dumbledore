After attacking three male Muggles who assaulted Ariana, he was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban. Percival died there sometime after 1891.[5][6] Many years later, his eldest son became the longest and most noted Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was considered by some as the greatest wizard of all time.  Contents  1 Biography 2 Physical appearance 3 Relationships  3.1 Kendra Dumbledore 3.2 Albus Dumbledore and Aberforth Dumbledore 3.3 Ariana Dumbledore   4 Etymology 5 Behind the scenes 6 Appearances 7 Notes and references   Biography Percival was a wizard, born into the presumably either pure-blood or half-blood Dumbledore family.[2] In his later life, he married a Muggle-born witch named Kendra with whom he had three children: Albus (who bore the same as his second name), Aberforth, and Ariana.[6] At the age of six, Percival's daughter Ariana was assaulted by three Muggle boys. The incident left her permanently traumatised and unable to control her magic powers. Percival, in a fit of vengeful rage, attacked her assailants. This resulted in his arrest and conviction by the Ministry of Magic. He was sentenced to Azkaban, where he later died. Percival never admitted the reasons for his attack on the Muggles. This was largely due to his fear that if the Ministry found out about his daughter's delicate condition, they would send her to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for the rest of her life, effectively locking her away permanently as a hazard to the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.[6]     Percival Dumbledore during his imprisonment in Azkaban   Percival's attack on the Muggle children led many to believe that he was a supporter of the notion of blood purity. However, this was almost certainly untrue as Percival's own wife was a Muggle-born witch. However, the Dumbledore family kept its secrets well, and Percival's reputation would remain tarnished even after the death of his 115-year-old son, Albus.[6] Posthumanously after his death sometime in the 1890s, Percival become a grandfather to his youngest son, Aberforth's son, Aurelius Dumbledore, born after the young man's relationship with a girl from Godric's Hollow the summer of 1899.[3] When Albus Dumbledore put on the Peverell Ring, with hopes that using the Resurrection Stone would allow him to see his loved ones once more, one of the people he hoped to see — and apologise to — was his father.[7]  Physical appearance As a relatively young wizard, Percival was described as "a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle,"[8] like his son, Albus, who, in his own time at Hogwarts, exhibited many of the same traits as his father.  Relationships Kendra Dumbledore    Percival's wife, Kendra   Percival's relationship with his wife during their marriage is unknown, but they shared a devotion to their children, particularly their youngest, Ariana. Percival attacked the three boys who assaulted their daughter, and Kendra devoted the remainder of her life to taking care of Ariana.[6]  Albus Dumbledore and Aberforth Dumbledore     Albus and Aberforth, his sons   Percival's relationship with his sons is not very clear. Percival did not seem to be held in high regard by Albus, especially for being imprisoned in Azkaban for an attack on three Muggles, but years later, Dumbledore wished to use the Resurrection Stone to bring back his deceased family and apologise to them — even his father, showing that Albus neverthless truly loved Percival despite all that happened. Like Albus, Aberforth may not have held his father in high regard either for his attack on the Muggles who attacked his sister, Ariana and being imprisoned in Azkaban.[6]  Ariana Dumbledore     Percival's daughter, Ariana    " [...] my father went after the bastards that did it, and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St Mungo's for good... We had to keep her safe and quiet." — Aberforth Dumbledore on Percival and Kendra Dumbledore[src]  Percival was devastated by his daughter's assault. He attacked the Muggle boys who did it and was sent to Azkaban for it. He never explained to the Ministry his reasons, knowing that if they discovered Ariana Dumbledore's condition, she would be confined to St Mungo's as a threat to the Statute of Secrecy.[6]  Etymology Percival was a knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. The name is believed to be derived from the Old French percer val, meaning "to pierce the valley".[9]  Behind the scenes In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Muriel claimed that Percival had "killed" the Muggles, rather than just cursing or magically assaulting them. She may have been exaggerating or the detail was changed in the film. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 5 images related to Percival Dumbledore. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (First mentioned) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (Appears in photographs) Pottermore Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Wizarding World Notes and references   ↑ Percival had to had been of-age (17) by the time of his first son, Albus was born in 1881, so before 1864.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 Percival was a wizard while his children were all half-bloods and his wife Kendra was Muggle-born, meaning he had to have been half-blood at least. Because of the truth about Percival's attack on Muggles being unsaid, it brought about the notion he supported pure-blood supremacy, implying he was a pure-blood himself.  ↑ 3.0 3.1 Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore  ↑ Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay, Scene 28  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 2 (In Memoriam)  ↑ 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 6.6 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 28 (The Missing Mirror)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 33 (The Prince's Tale)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 11 (The Bribe)  ↑ Behind the Name: Percival              Categories         Categories:   Azkaban convicts    Blood traitors    British individuals    Buried at Azkaban burial ground    Dumbledore family    Males    Married individuals    Parents    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Deutsch Español Suomi Français 日本語 Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
