He ultimately lost possession of the Elder Wand at some point, presumably by being defeated in a duel, killed, disarmed or by having the wand stolen.  Etymology The name "Hereward" is derived from the Old English elements here "army" and weard "guard", from which the magical kind of "ward" (as a protection) is also derived. This was the name of an 11th-century Anglo-Saxon leader who rebelled against Norman rule.
