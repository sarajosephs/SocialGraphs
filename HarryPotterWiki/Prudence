She was the sister of Modesty Rabnott, who she had received a letter from after she lost her home.[1]  Behind the scenes It is possible her surname is "Rabnott" since this was her sister's surname and there was no mention of Modesty having a husband come with her. It is possible, however, that Prudence was married. In 1269, the Statute of Secrecy did not exist, meaning that it is possible for Prudence to be a Muggle who knows about magic.
