They all entered the service of Lord Voldemort during the height of the First Wizarding War.[3] Wilkes fought in several battles of the war. In 1980, a year before Lord Voldemort's downfall, Wilkes was caught by Aurors and was killed, while attempting to avoid being imprisoned in Azkaban.[3]  Magical abilities and skills Dark Arts: Being a Death Eater, Wilkes would have been highly proficient and accomplished in dark magic. More than likely, they would have been able to perform the Unforgivable Curses, along with various other dark charms and spells. Duelling: Being a Death Eater who participated and fought in the First Wizarding War, Wilkes likely at least a fairly competent duellist with some skill in martial magic. Despite this, they were not able to avoid being killed by Aurors.[3] Behind the scenes Wilkes is only mentioned once in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and Sirius Black does not specify their gender. Wilkes shares its name with Annie Wilkes, the main antagonist of Stephen King's 1987 novel Misery, characterised mainly by her cruelty, which may have been the inspiration for the character's name and possible personality, given its nature as a Death Eater, although this is unconfirmed.
