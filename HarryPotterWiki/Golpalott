Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott’s Third Law ... who can tell me — ? But Miss Granger can, of course!" — Horace Slughorn teaching sixth year Potions students about Golpalott[src]  Golpalott was (possibly) the wizard or witch who formulated Golpalott's Third Law.[1] Alternatively, it may have been named after him or her by someone else.  Behind the scenes It is likely that his name is a pun on the phrase "Gulp a lot", which they may have been inclined to do so as a potioneer.
