We will arrest you and you will probably find yourself in Azkaban. I advise you to call a halt to this feud before somebody gets hurt. In the meantime, contact the Office for the Removal of Curses, Jinxes and Hexes, who will take care of both the broomstick and your brother." — Dempster Wiggleswade's reply on the Problem Page of the Daily Prophet[src]  Dempster Wiggleswade was a wizard who worked for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.[1]  Biography He also wrote for the Daily Prophet, using his legal expertise to answer some of the questions submitted to the problem page, which also featured responses from Grizel Hurtz, Zamira Gulch, and Helbert Spleen. He strongly advised Buckley Cooper not to take revenge on his brother by turning his children into vampire ferrets.[1] Following the return of Lord Voldemort, he answered security questions from Daily Prophet readers.[2]  Appearances Daily Prophet Newsletters (First mentioned) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (Mentioned in Daily Prophet) Harry Potter Limited Edition (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 Daily Prophet Newsletters  ↑ Harry Potter Limited Edition, see this image     Department of Magical Law Enforcement employees      Heads of Department   Justus Pilliwickle · Torquil Travers · Bartemius Crouch Senior · Amelia Bones · Pius Thicknesse · Corban Yaxley · Arthur Weasley · Harry Potter   Auror Office   Heads: Theseus Scamander · Rufus Scrimgeour · Gawain Robards · Harry Potter    Mordecai Berrycloth · John Dawlish · Penelope Fawley · Dorian Fungbury · Timothy Hale · Alice Longbottom · Frank Longbottom · Neville Longbottom · Alastor Moody · Riya Patel · Proudfoot · Savage · Kingsley Shacklebolt · Nymphadora Tonks · Ronald Weasley · Williamson · Unidentified Aurors · Unidentified male Auror at Hogwarts · Four Unidentified Aurors at Hogwarts · Director of the Investigation Department No. 61042   Improper Use of Magic Office   Heads: Travers · Dolores Umbridge    Mafalda Hopkirk · Honoria's fiancé · Mafalda Hopkirk's Ministerial Superior · Rufus Fudge · Orabella Nuttley · Chester Davies · Linderina Crane   Other personnel   Leta Lestrange · Minerva McGonagall · Elphinstone Urquart · Alastor Gumboil · Arnold Peasegood · Arthur Weasley · Perkins · Cerberus Langarm · Hermione Granger · Bob Ogden · Tulip Karasu's mother · Tulip Karasu's father · Dempster Wiggleswade · Amelia Bones's assistant · Arthur Weasley's ten subordinates · Unidentified Hit Wizard · Unidentified Wizengamot clerk    Daily Prophet employees   Editor-in-chief  Barnabas Cuffe  Reporters  A.
