Biography He was a member of Ravenclaw house and claimed that he achieved nine "Outstandings" in his O.W.L exams. Eddie swore his success was solely as a result of Baruffio's Brain Elixir and attempted to sell it to younger students preparing for their exams, including Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley. However, Hermione Granger stopped him, confiscated the potion and poured its contents down a toilet.[2]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First appearance) Pottermore (Mentioned only) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 31 (O.W.L.s)              Categories         Categories:   1970s births    British or Irish individuals    Con artists    Males    Ravenclaws    Sorted in 1990    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
