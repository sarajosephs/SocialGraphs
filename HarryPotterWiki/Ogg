In 1995, Molly became intrigued by the Whomping Willow when she visited Harry Potter during the third task, and she reminisced at length about Ogg.[2]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 31 (The Third Task)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 17 (The Heir of Slytherin)        Preceded by:Unknown  Gamekeeper of Hogwarts1943 or earlier - 1961 or later  Succeeded by:Rubeus Hagrid         Hogwarts faculty   Founders  Godric Gryffindor | Helga Hufflepuff | Rowena Ravenclaw | Salazar Slytherin   Headteachers  Giffard Abbott | Walter Aragon | Bearded man holding a book | Phineas Nigellus Black | Elizabeth Burke | Antonia Creaseworthy | Dilys Derwent | Armando Dippet | Albus Dumbledore | Mordicus Egg | Everard | First headmaster | Dexter Fortescue | Basil Fronsac | Brian Gagwilde | Limebert | Minerva McGonagall | Eupraxia Mole | Pink-faced headmaster | Resting headmaster | Edessa Sakndenberg | Brutus Scrimgeour | Phyllida Spore | Severus Snape | Amrose Swott | Quentin Trimble | Dolores Umbridge | Fytherley Undercliffe | Vindictus Viridian | Vulpus | Heliotrope Wilkins | Gimlet-eyed headmistress | Headmaster (1568) | Headteacher (1792) | Headmaster in blue | Headmaster with book | Headmaster in gold | Headmaster with apple | Headmaster with astrolabe | Headmaster with castle sketch | Headmaster with paper | Headmaster with rings | Headmaster with scroll | Headmaster with sphere | Headmaster with starmap | Headmaster with wand   Deputy Heads  Minerva McGonagall | Amycus Carrow | Alecto Carrow   Heads of House  Muldoon Cragg | Filius Flitwick | Godric Gryffindor | Gryffindor lady | Gryffindor man (II) | Gryffindor man (III) | Gryffindor man (IV) | Gryffindor Seeker | Helga Hufflepuff | Neville Longbottom | Minerva McGonagall  | Valeria Myriadd | Uric Oapley | Podric Piles | Prendergast | Rowena Ravenclaw | Horace Slughorn | Salazar Slytherin | Severus Snape | Pomona Sprout | Tobias Stump   Teaching staff  Bartholomew | Bathsheda Babbling | Herbert Beery | Cuthbert Binns | Brindlemore | Charity Burbage | Camelia | Alecto Carrow | Amycus Carrow | Bartemius Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody) | Clodagh Dromgoole | Albus Dumbledore | Eleazar Fig | Firenze | Filius Flitwick | Fortinbras | Jakub Gorski | Olivia Green | Rubeus Hagrid | Hecat | Rolanda Hooch | Ernesto Jags | Arsenius Jigger | Igor Karkaroff's Yule Ball partner | Silvanus Kettleburn | Gilderoy Lockhart | Neville Longbottom | Remus Lupin | Elspeth MacGillony | Mazoni | Minerva McGonagall | Galatea Merrythought | Natsai Onai's mother | Prendergast | Quirinus Quirrell | Patricia Rakepick | Abraham Ronen | Concordia Rowle | Arif Sikander | Aurora Sinistra | Horace Slughorn | Severus Snape | Pomona Sprout | Swoopstikes | Sybill Trelawney | Trocar | Dolores Umbridge | Septima Vector | Unidentified professor | Potions professor (16th century) | Flying Instructor (19th century) | Herbology professor (19th century) | Potions professor (19th century) | DADA professor (1984–1985) | DADA professor (1985–1986) | DADA professor (1986–1987) | DADA professor (1987–1988) | DADA professor (1989–1990) | DADA professor (1990–1991) | Muggle Studies professor (1990s) | DADA professor (1998–?) | Potions professor (21st century) | Charms professor (?th century)   Hogwarts house-elves  Bilm | Boil-ridden house-elf | Deek | Dobby | Filk | Gimkey | Krafty | Kreacher | Pitts | Retch | Vekey | Wigby | Winky | Unidentified house-elf   Support staff  Rancorous Carpe | Argus Filch | Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank | Rubeus Hagrid | Rolanda Hooch | Hankerton Humble | Ogg | Irma Pince | Poppy Pomfrey | Apollyon Pringle | Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus | Wainscott | Unidentified Healers | Unidentified female nurse | Unidentified librarian | Unidentified male nurse             Categories         Categories:   British or Irish individuals    Hogwarts gamekeepers    Males    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Deutsch Suomi Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
