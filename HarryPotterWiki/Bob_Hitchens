Their marriage caused her to be struck off the Black family tree tapestry.[3]  Behind the scenes It was not clear at first whether Hitchens was a Muggle or a Muggle-born wizard. Although the partial family tree on the Harry Potter Lexicon lists him as a Muggle, it does the same for Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks, possibly indicating that the Blacks did not draw a distinction between Muggles and Muggle-borns. However, in the partial tree written by J. K. Rowling given in the Harry Potter Film Wizardry, Ted Tonks is listed as a Muggle-born and Hitchens as a Muggle. Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Appears on Black family tapestry) Notes and references   ↑ Harry Potter Film Wizardry  ↑ The hand-drawn tree by J.K. Rowling expressly states that Bob Hitchens is a Muggle, and as her word is the highest form of canon, we know he is a Muggle.  ↑ House of Black              Categories         Categories:   British individuals    Disowned members of the House of Black    Hitchens family    Males    Married individuals    Muggles             Languages      Français Polski      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
