And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?""Well, Ted, I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight." — Ted and Jim McGuffin[src]  Ted was a Muggle television newsreader in 1981, working alongside Jim McGuffin. Following the downfall of Lord Voldemort, he reported on the unusual amount of owl activity during the day as messages were passed throughout the Wizarding world, while being unaware that the activity was a result of the celebrations of Lord Voldemort's apparent demise.[1]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 1 (The Boy Who Lived)              Categories         Categories:   British individuals    Journalists    Males    Muggles    Television             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Português do Brasil Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
