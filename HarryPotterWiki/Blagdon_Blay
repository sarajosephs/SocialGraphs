In a single night, the wizarding doors of London were sealed shut, and task-forces were dispatched to protect Muggle houses, too." — Miranda Goshawk, Book of Spells.[src]  Blagdon Blay (fl. early 1600s) was an English wizard and a Londoner in the early 17th century who was responsible for the creation of the Anti-Alohomora Charm — effectively stopping a series of burglaries by wizards using the then-innovative Unlocking Charm.[1]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography When thief Eldon Elsrickle introduced the Unlocking Spell (which he had learnt from an ancient African sorcerer) to London, there was an unprecedented series of recurring burglaries and break-ins by unscrupulous wizards, upon the homes of Muggles and fellow wizards alike.[1] Blagdon Blay had his house broken into nineteen times in the course of just two weeks. He managed to develop an Anti-Alohomora Charm to secure his house, and soon all the London wizards sealed their houses shut at night, and special wizard task-forces protected those of Muggles.[1]  Magical abilities and skills Charms: Blay was highly accomplished with charm-work, having successfully invented the Anti-Alohomora Charm, which he ingeniously used to prevent locks being broken with the Unlocking Charm and preventing theft, to great success. Spell creation: Blay succeeded in the highly difficult magical art of inventing new spells, having invented the immensely useful Anti-Alohomora Charm, an excellent magical achievement given the success of the charm.
