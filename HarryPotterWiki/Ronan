He was described as speaking with a doleful tone, and seemed rather peaceful compared to other centaurs.[3] He led the charge of the centaurs from the Forbidden Forest during the Battle of Hogwarts, breaking through the Death Eater ranks into the Great Hall. It is likely that he witnessed the final battle between Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter.[2]  Physical description He was described as having red hair, and a red beard. Below the waist, he had a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long and reddish tail.[1]  Etymology Rónán (anglicized Ronan) is an Irish male given name meaning "little seal", Rón meaning "seal", and -án being a diminutive suffix in Irish Gaelic).  Behind the scenes Ronan is the first Centaur introduced in the Wizarding World franchise, appearing shortly before Bane in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
