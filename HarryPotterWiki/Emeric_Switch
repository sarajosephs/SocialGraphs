Emeric Switch   Biographical information  Died Before the 1990s (possibly)   Title(s) Professor[1]    Physical information  Species Human   Gender Male    Affiliation  Occupation Author   [Source]  Professor[1] Emeric Switch was a wizard, author and expert on Transfiguration.  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 Behind the scenes 5 Appearances 6 Notes and references   Biography Switch was the author of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration.[2][3] This book was a required textbook for first-year and second-year Transfiguration classes at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[2][3] He also contributed an article on the scientific aspects of Human Transfiguration to Transfiguration Today in 1926.[4] A portrait of him hung at Hogwarts Castle.[1]  Magical abilities and skills Transfiguration: Switch was an expert on this highly advanced, complicated and scientific branch of magic, having authored the Transfiguration textbook A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration, as well as having contributed to the academic journal Transfiguration Today about Human Transfiguration, showing his proficiency and skill in this field. Etymology Emeric is a variant of Emmerich, which means "whole, universal". This could relate to him being able to do transfiguration, as he can wholly turn something into something universally else. To switch is to exchange one thing with another; could be extended to transfiguration, changing one form into another.  Behind the scenes Emeric Switch's portrait, as featured in the Harry Potter films, seems to have been based on a c. 1795 portrait of English poet Robert Southey, by Pieter van Dyke.
