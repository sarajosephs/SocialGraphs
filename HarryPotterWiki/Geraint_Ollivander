Geraint came from a long line of wizards who began selling wands in 382 B.C.[2]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Early life 1.2 Career as a wandmaker   2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography Early life Geraint Ollivander was born in the Middle Ages, somewhere in Great Britain. He was born into the wizarding Ollivander family, who had been in the wand-making business since 382 B.C.[2]  Career as a wandmaker Geraint took up the family business in London, studying further into wandlore and becoming an accomplished wandmaker. He considered it an honour to match a witch or wizard with a wand made from the wood of the cypress tree because it indicated he had met someone who was going to die heroically, and left that fact in his writings.[2]  Etymology "Geraint" is a name of unknown origin, possibly a Welsh form of the Late Roman name "Gerontius" deriving from Greek γέρων (gérōn), meaning "old man". Geraint was the name of a figure various Welsh legends. He was also incorprorated into later Arthurian tales as one of the knights of the Round Table and the husband of Enid.[3] Appearances Pottermore (Mentioned only) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Writing by J.
