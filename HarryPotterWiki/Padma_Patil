You'd think they'd be together, wouldn't you?" — Comment regarding the Patil twins[src]  Padma Patil (b. 1979/1980) was a British witch of Indian heritage who was in the same year as the famous Harry Potter at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[13] She was the identical twin sister of Parvati Patil. Padma was sorted into Ravenclaw house, although her identical twin was sorted into Gryffindor, and became a prefect in her fifth year. She was also a member of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter.[4] She later fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.[14] Padma survived the final battle of the Second Wizarding War and graduated from school.[15] She was most likely present for Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort.

They were probably raised in a wizarding household.[16]  Hogwarts years (1991-1998)    Padma's Sorting in 1991   In 1991, Padma began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was in the same class as the famous Harry Potter. She was sorted into Ravenclaw house, which values wit and creativity. Parvati was sorted into Gryffindor, which values the brave and the bold. This separated the two sisters.[13] Padma shared a dormitory with Mandy Brocklehurst, Lisa Turpin, Morag MacDougal, and Sue Li.  It is likely that Padma and Parvati both knew Pansy Parkinson before starting their education, due to the way Pansy addressed Parvati.[17]  Fourth year  Padma: "Are you going to ask me to dance at all?" Ron Weasley: "No." Padma: "Fine." — Padma's unsuccessful date with Ron at the Yule Ball[src]  Padma's fourth year at Hogwarts school would play host to the Triwizard Tournament, where students from three schools competed against one another. Normally three finalists are selected from the Goblet of Fire, but this year four students were selected, two from Hogwarts: Cedric Diggory and Harry Potter.[5]      Parvati, Harry, Ron, and Padma at the Yule Ball   As part of the tournament, a traditional Yule Ball is held by the hosting school, Padma attended the Yule Ball with Ron Weasley, at the urging of Parvati (Harry's date) when Harry begged her to find a date for Ron. Padma, however, was less than enthusiastic at having Ron as a partner, since he refused to dance with her and instead spent the evening stewing in jealousy over Hermione's date with Viktor Krum.  Padma wore turquoise dress robes for the occasion. Due to both Harry and Ron showing a lack of interest in spending time with the twins, Padma and Parvati both abandoned their dates and danced with some boys from Beauxbatons.[5]      Padma at the memorial of Cedric Diggory   Padma became more interested in Ron Weasley after he became one of the hostages for the second task and spoke with him in the halls several times, intrigued with what had occurred. He assured her that he had his wand hidden and that he could have taken on the merpeople any time. Padma and her twin sister also attended the memorial of Cedric Diggory. They sat next to a boy from Durmstrang.[5]  Fifth year  Padma Patil: "Hey Harry, we got some more Babbling Beverage." Dolores Umbridge: "Remember children, Mr Filch has a... a terrible smell." Padma Patil: "She's finally making sense." — Parvati and Padma asking Harry to pour Babbling Beverage into a speaker[src]  In 1995, Padma became a prefect for Ravenclaw along with Anthony Goldstein. Padma's fifth year would have the school undergo the watchful eye of the Ministry through Dolores Umbridge, who would be appointed High Inquisitor as well as Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Umbridge refused to teach any of her students practical magic which led to an uproar against her.[4]      Padma and Parvati standing next to Harry Potter at a D.A. meeting   Padma attended the Hog's Head for the founding meeting of Dumbledore's Army (a group formed by Harry Potter and created to fight back against Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad) with her sister, and signed the parchment saying she wouldn't reveal any secrets that the group hold. She then became a member of Dumbledore's Army and participated in many of the meetings held. She learned how to cast new spells such as a the Patronus charm, but she only ever succeeded in casting a non-corporeal Patronus.[12] During one meeting, Padma was accidentally Stunned by Neville Longbottom, who had been aiming for Dean Thomas instead.[4] Padma's rebellious side had really started to show after becoming a member of Dumbledore's Army. Padma, Parvati, and Harry Potter started to destroy the speakers that Umbridge had placed around the castle in an attempt to silence her.[18]  Sixth year  "People are terrified — you know the Patil twins' parents want them to go home?" — Padma and Parvati's parents concern for their daughter's safety[src]      Padma in N.E.W.T.-level potions   In 1996, Padma and Parvati's parents initially didn't want their daughters to return to Hogwarts, though they were convinced to allow it. That year Hogwarts would be under attack from Death Eaters, and Dumbledore's Army was called into arms. However, neither Padma nor Parvati had their coins that signalled this call on them and did not participate in the battle.[9] But as a result Mr and Mrs Patil insisted on bringing their daughters home the day after, due to the battle resulting in Albus Dumbledore's death at the end of the school year. Padma was unable to attend Dumbledore's funeral, having been taken home before breakfast.[9]  Seventh year  "Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner." — The D.A. members residing in the Room of Requirement[src]      D.A. members in 1998   In 1998, Hogwarts was under the control of Lord Voldemort and his followers. Students were brutally punished and taught different subjects. For example, how to use dark magic instead of defending against it. Sensing the need for rebellion yet again, Padma and her sister Parvati both joined the reconstituted Dumbledore's Army. They stood up against Death Eater control of Hogwarts.  Padma's parents had not attempted to withdraw her and her sister from school, as it had now become compulsory attendance for pure-blood and half-blood students.[14] Padma may have participated in spray painting the walls or helping fellow students who were also suffering, as many students did at the time. She would hide in the Room of Requirement, as the room had become a sort of sanctuary for D.A. members.  Battle of Hogwarts  "He looked hopefully towards the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny's chair." — Harry seeking help from Ravenclaws during his search for the diadem[src]  In May, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger returned to Hogwarts after taking the year off to destroy Horcruxes. With Harry's return, Dumbledore's Army was stronger than it had ever been. But with this return, Voldemort and his Death Eaters came looking for Harry.       Padma with Katie, Cho, and Leanne after the battle   Hogwarts staff and students refused to simply hand Harry over without a fight, and in return a fight is what they got. Padma participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, fighting alongside her sister and Dean Thomas.[14] She most likely witnessed Harry Potter's final defat of Lord Voldemort, thus ending the Second Wizarding War.  Padma survived the battle and was later seen in the Great Hall. She was talking with Cho Chang, Katie Bell, and Leanne.[15]  Later life (1998-?) After the battle she most likely kept his D.A. coin as a badge of honour, as did other D.A. members.  Alternate 2020 When Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Potter went back in time to save Cedric Diggory, they caused past Hermione to get suspicious of Viktor Krum. Because of this she went to the Yule Ball with Ron instead. This never revealed the jealousy Ron had of her and Krum. Thus, the alternate version of Ron married Padma instead of Hermione. They had a son named Panju together.[10]    Padma in her fifth  year, age 15   Physical appearance  "I still can't work out how you two got the two best-looking girls in the year." — Dean Thomas on Padma and Parvati[src]  Both Padma and her sister were described by Dean Thomas in 1994 as "the two best-looking girls in the year". They are both very attractive girls with dark eyes and long dark hair.[8][6] Parvati usually wore her hair in a plait and Padma may have done likewise. Both sisters were usually seen wearing silver necklaces with the letter "P" hanging from the chains around their necks and over their ties during their Hogwarts years.  Personality and traits  "She didn't look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down." — Padma's lack of enthusiasm for having Ron as her Yule Ball date[src]  Padma seemed to be the less outgoing and more studious of the twins. She was sorted into Ravenclaw, a mark of her intelligence. Padma was not yet asked to the Yule Ball by the time she was fixed up with Ron Weasley; as despite her physical beauty the boys in her year did not seem to be interested in her, possibly due to her intelligence, not even Dean Thomas who seemed to have attended the ball alone. Padma was also made a prefect, something her sister never achieved, making her appear better trusted for the position by her teachers than her sister.  She was also much quieter than her sister Parvati.[4] She was very annoyed when Parvati began dancing with another male Hogwarts student other than her date, but when Ron didn't want to dance with her, she deserted him as well, something Luna Lovegood later found hard to understand her reasoning behind. Her desertion of Ron after seeming angry that her sister deserted Harry made her slightly hypocritical.[5] In spite of her flaws, Padma, much like her Gryffindor sister, was a courageous and determined individual, being unafraid to disobey and stand up to Dolores Umbridge's tyranny,[4][18] and later bravely fought in the Battle of Hogwarts against the Death Eaters and survived.[14]  Magical abilities and skills Defence Against the Dark Arts: Padma along with her sister were loyal and devoted members of Dumbledore's Army, where she learned how to cast numerous defensive and offensive spells.[4] Potions: In 1996, Padma and Parvati successfully brewed Babbling Beverage to disturb Dolores Umbridge's loudspeakers.[18] Unlike her sister, she took N.E.W.T. classes in this subject in her sixth year. This indicated she earned either an 'Outstanding' or 'Exceeds Expectations' O.W.L. in the subject, showing her proficiency in this field.[19] Duelling: Padma would have been a very skilled and accomplished duellist, as she was taught how to duel as a member of Dumbledore's Army[4] and later survived the Battle of Hogwarts in 1997, showing her excellent skills in martial magic, given her ability to fight successfully against the Death Eaters and survive.[14] Charms: Padma was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal Patronus.[12] This is a mark of superior magical ability and talent, given the immense difficulty of casting such an advanced and powerful protective charm. She presumably learnt how to perform this charm with Dumbledore's Army. Possessions Wand: Padma owned a wand, that was of an unknown length, wood and core material. She presumably purchased it from Ollivanders, Diagon Alley, before starting Hogwarts in 1991, and wielded her wand throughout her school life. Dress robes: Along with her sister, Padma owned dress robes for which she wore to formal occasions and celebrations, such as for the Yule Ball in 1994. They were turquoise in colour.[5] Prefect badge: Padma owned a Ravenclaw Prefect Badge, due to her becoming a Prefect in her fifth year in 1995.[4] Etymology The Patils' names and appearance in the films imply that the characters are of Indian descent. Patil is a common Marathi surname in the state of Maharashtra, India. It signifies that at least one of Padma's ancestors was a village head in western India. In Sanskrit, Padma means "lotus," which symbolises divinity and purity, because of its nature and birth in dirty mud water. Also, Padma is a by-name for the Hindu goddess of prosperity, Lakshmi, the consort of the Hindu god of protection, Lord Vishnu.  Rowling initially intended her and her sister to bear forenames beginning with Ma. Their surname on Rowling's class list is also spelled as "Patel", which is another version of the name Patil but from a different region of India (Gujarat); this surname represents a community of agriculturalists and merchants.  Behind the scenes     Padma incorrectly shown in Gryffindor colours   In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and subsequent films, Padma is shown to be in Gryffindor along with Parvati, instead of Ravenclaw, but in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 and Years 5-7 she is in Ravenclaw. According to actress Afshan Azad, the decision to put Padma in Gryffindor was made, because the director feared that audience wouldn't understand that the Patils were sisters if they were each in a different house. The Patils are not portrayed as identical twins in the films, but rather fraternal twins who look alike in some ways, as the actresses who play the girls are not sisters in real life. Afshan Azad (Padma) speaks in a Mancunian accent from Manchester, while Shefali Chowdhury (Parvati) normally speaks in a Brummie accent as she grew up in Birmingham. To combine the two, they speak in a general Northern English accent, but still distinguishable from a Yorkshire accent (Neville). Padma's name is never spoken aloud in the film series, though her name appears in the end credits for Goblet of Fire. Padma is portrayed by Sharon Sandhu in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. However, she was recast and was portrayed by Afshan Azad in later films. In  Pottermore, J. K. Rowling's early names for Padma and Parvati are given with: Madhari Patel and Mati Patel.[20] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 71 images related to Padma Patil.
