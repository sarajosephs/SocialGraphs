This article is about the author of Unfogging the Future. You may be looking for the ancestor of Sybill Trelawney, another seer.         Cassandra Vablatsky   Biographical information  Born 1894[1]   Died 1997[1] (aged 102 - 103)    Physical information  Species Human[1]   Gender Female[1]   Hair colour Brown[1]   Eye colour Purple[2]   Skin colour Light[1]    Affiliation  Occupation Seer[1]Author[3]   [Source]  Cassandra Vablatsky (1894 - 1997) was a witch, celebrated Seer and author of Unfogging the Future, a Divination textbook required at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[3][1]  Contents  1 Magical abilities and skills 2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Magical abilities and skills Divination: Vablastsky was an esteemed Seer,[1] meaning she was naturally gifted with the Inner Eye and could receive genunine visions of the future. She even authored a textbook on the subject, titled Unfogging the Future.[3] Etymology Cassandra means "oracle". In Greek mythology, Cassandra means "she who entangles men" and she was the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba. Apollo, god of archery and poetry, as well as oracles, fell in love for her beauty and gave her the gift of prophecy. However, when she did not return his love, Apollo placed a curse on her so that no one would ever believe her predictions and her visions would only be of tragic events yet to come.  Behind the scenes Vablatsky’s date of death was given on a Famous Wizard Card in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which takes place in 1991-1992, but Vablatsky’s death occurred six years later. This might have been a mistake, or possibly Vablatsky (or another Seer) foresaw her death and it was added to her biography. She was likely named after Madame Helena Blavatsky, a 19th-century psychic and founder of the Theosophy movement and early proponent of New Age philosophy, who was declared a fraud in 1885 by the Society of Psychical Research. She was known for fusing ideas of modern science with esoteric tenets of Eastern spirituality. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 4 images related to Cassandra Vablatsky.
