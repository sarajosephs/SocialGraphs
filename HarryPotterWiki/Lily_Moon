She was in the same year as Harry Potter and was Sorted into either Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin.[4][3]  Behind the scenes Only Lily's surname was revealed during the Sorting Ceremony in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, but on the student list shown on Harry Potter and Me, the first three letters of her first name could be made out as either "Lil-" or "Lib-". Her full first name was finally revealed by J. K. Rowling as supplementary content on the  Pottermore website.[5] According to Rowling, this character was named before she settled on the name of Harry Potter's mother, and was the "first intimation of Luna Lovegood", giving her the idea for a "fey, dreamy girl".[5] During a practical examination, for their O.W.L.s, Lily was not called to take her test. She would usually appear after Draco Malfoy but before Theodore Nott. This could just be a mistake of J. K. Rowling's, or Lily may have been unable to attend her test. It is possible that she had failed her exams at a point between the first and fourth year, forcing her to repeat the year.

As all five Ravenclaw females are known, the remaining females whose houses are unknown must be in one of the other three houses.  ↑ Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 7 (The Sorting Hat)  ↑ 5.0 5.1  Pottermore (transcription available here)              Categories         Categories:   20th century births    British or Irish individuals    Females    Moon family    Sorted in 1991    Unknown House    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
