This article is about the activist. You may be looking for Heliotrope Wilkins.   Heliotrope Willis   Biographical information  Born 1982 or earlier[1]   Nationality British[2]    Physical information  Species Human[2]   Gender Female[2]    Affiliation  Occupation Leader of the Troll Rights Movement[2]   Loyalty Troll Rights Movement[2]   [Source]  Heliotrope Willis was a British witch who lead the activist group Troll Rights Movement. She claimed trolls had a non-violent nature and made excellent guards, but, ironically, when her group crashed an anti-troll rally, she was knocked unconscious by indiscriminate club-swinging of the trolls present.[2]  Etymology Heliotrope is a term used to describe a plant which turns to face the sun, derived from the Greek helios, "sun", and tropein, "to turn."[3] In the language of flowers, heliotropes represent devotion.[4] Miss Heliotrope is a character in The Little White Horse, a 1946 novel by Elizabeth Goudge, which was a childhood favourite of J. K. Rowling.[5] The surname Willis is derived from the given name William,[6] which means "will helmet", from the Germanic elements wil, "will," and helm, "helmet."[7]  Appearances Daily Prophet Newsletters (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ As a leader of an activist group, she was likely over 17.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Daily Prophet Newsletters: 8 February, 1999, Page 1  ↑ " Heliotropium on  Wikipedia  ↑  Language_of_flowers on  Wikipedia  ↑ Sydney Morning Herald article on Accio Quote!  ↑ "Willis" on Behind the Name  ↑ "William" on Behind the Name              Categories         Categories:   Activists    British individuals    Females    Wizards             Languages      Español Italiano      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
