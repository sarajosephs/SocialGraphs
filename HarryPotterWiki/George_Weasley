George's first few years were marked by the height of the First Wizarding War and Lord Voldemort's first fall. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1989 to 1996 with Fred, and was sorted into Gryffindor House. He and Fred were popular students, joining the Circle of Khanna in their first year, becoming Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team in their second year and members of Dumbledore's Army in their unfinished seventh year.  A born prankster and inventor, George left Hogwarts prior to graduation to become a successful entrepreneur with Fred, and opened the joke shop Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes at 93 Diagon Alley. He was a member of the Order of the Phoenix and fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts; in the latter, Fred died, leaving George devastated. Sometime after the end of the Second Wizarding War, George married Angelina Johnson, with whom he had a son named Fred in honour of his late twin, and a daughter named Roxanne. He and his brother Ron also turned Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes into a huge money spinner.

We thought they just liked the noise." — Ginny Weasley on the twins' experiments[src]      The Burrow, where George grew up along with his family   George Weasley was born 1 April 1978, April Fool's Day, which was very appropriate as he and his brother Fred were mischievous pranksters. Fred was born first.[16][17] George was raised at his family home of the Burrow, near Ottery St Catchpole in Devon, England. He and Fred were younger than siblings Bill, Charlie, and Percy, and older than siblings Ron and Ginny. Although the family was poor, they were loving and happy and Fred and George had a good childhood because of it. George and Fred were troublemakers from a young age, delighting in playing clever pranks and in teasing their siblings (especially Percy), and it was a challenge for their mother to try to keep them under control. It was not uncommon for explosions to be heard coming from the bedroom they shared.[18] Some of the stunts they pulled as children include setting a Dungbomb off under their great-aunt Muriel's chair during a Christmas dinner,[9] turning Ron's teddy bear into a giant spider after Ron accidentally broke Fred's toy broomstick,[7] giving Ron an Acid Pop which burnt a hole in his tongue,[14] and nearly tricking Ron into taking an Unbreakable Vow.[14]  Hogwarts years (1989–1996) Early years  Fred Weasley: "Don't worry, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls." George: "We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat." — George and Fred departing for their third year[src]  George was educated at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1989-1996, and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. He and his twin brother made very good friends with fellow Gryffindors Lee Jordan, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, and Oliver Wood, and became well known for their senses of humour. During their first year at Hogwarts, George and Fred swiped the Marauder's Map from Argus Filch's office, which further aided in their mischief.[11] It was said to Harry Potter by their youngest brother, Ron, that Fred and George achieved 'really good marks', at least in their early years of schooling[2] despite their constant pranks.  First year  Sir Cadogan: "Fred and George Weasley delight in tormenting Merlin and me whenever they pass through, and this time was no different. They even have the nerve to call Merin overrated! He's outraged! Isn't that right friend?" Merlin: "It is a fool's pastime to pay mind to those who only wish to get a rise out of you." Sir Cadogan: "He's putting on a brave face, but, I assure you, he is quite upset!" — Sir Cadogan on how Fred and George Weasley insulted his and Merlin's paintings[src]  George started his first year in the 1989–1990 school year, along with Fred. At the start of the school year, he and Fred introduced themselves to the Hogwarts Librarian Madam Pince by re-organising the library shelves, much to her anger. They introduced themselves to Jacob's sibling in the library, who was with Charlie and Percy and told them to avoid Pince, with George leaving for detention that Fred was responsible for. Fred promised to take the blame next time, with Percy lecturing them for causing trouble so early in the school year.[19] During he and his brother's time in the kitchens, Pitts, the house-elf in charge of the kitchens, gave one of them a broom for the purpose of cleaning, but he thought Pitts wanted him to fly. And during their time in detention, one of them burnt water, which seemed impossible to Jae Kim. And in the meantime, one of them mixed up mayonnaise with paste, so Pitts forced him to scrub the whole kitchen with his toothbrush.[20] They were so bad at cooking that one of the house-elves in the kitchens stated that compared to them, Jacob's sibling was a master chef.[20] During the return of William Weasley to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he and his brother went missing, and during Jacob's sibling and Charles Weasley's searches, they come to Sir Cadogan's painting. At first he pretended to be unwilling to help them because of the twins' rude personality and insulting him and Merlin, but after asking Jacob's sibling that would have they helped if were in his shoes, he admitted that a knight must help others in need no matter what. While helping, he also admitted that he challenged the twins into a duel but they just had laughed and left.[21] Also during this school year, he and Fred expressed an interest in becoming members of the Circle of Khanna, a student organisation dedicated to the memory of Rowan Khanna, combating 'R' and finding the final Cursed Vault. He and George went to a meeting of this society in Classroom 1B, where Jae Kim managed to convince Jacob's sibling in Classroom 3C to let them both join, as they were younger students. Jacob's sibling went back to Classroom 1B with Jae where the other students explained their plans to them.[15]  Second year     George playing in Quidditch match against Slytherin   In his second year in the 1990–1991 school year, George gained a position on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as a Beater, as did Fred. They were both extremely skilled players, described by Oliver Wood as being like 'human Bludgers'.[2] Also during his second year, he and Fred attended a meeting of the Circle of Khanna in Classroom 3C, where Jacob's sibling updated the group on important news and information relevant to them.[22] Later during this year, he and Fred stole Victor Ketsueki's coffin as a prank, and hid it in the Hogwarts kitchens. When Victor eventually found his coffin there and opened it, he was glitter-bombed, much to the watching twins' amusement, which was another feature of their prank.[23] During this year, he and Fred developed early prototypes for the Skiving Snackbox, which fellow Gryffindor Jae Kim took from their rooms and read.[24]  Third year  "You haven't got a letter on yours. I suppose he thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid — we know our names are Gred and Forge." — George joking about his Weasley sweater during Christmas[src]      George in the Great Hall having breakfast with fellow Gryffindors   George started his third year in 1991, when his younger brother Ron began his first year, along with Harry Potter, who soon became his best friend. Harry joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team as its Seeker, and became friendly with George and Fred as well. For Christmas, Harry received a Weasley jumper along with George, Fred, Ron, and their other brother Percy. The twins' jumpers had their initials on them, prompting George to quip that they knew they were 'Gred and Forge'.[2] George also insisted that his older brother Percy wear his jumper and sit with his brothers instead of the other Prefects, reminding him that the Christmas holidays were a time for family.[2] He, along with the rest of the family, was immensely proud of Ron when the latter beat Professor McGonagall's giant chess set. George was also on the Gryffindor Quidditch team that had the worst loss in 300 years in the Quidditch final without Harry as Seeker because of his encounter with Quirinus Quirrell. While Harry was unconscious in the hospital wing, George and Fred attempted to send Harry a toilet seat, showing their friendly side toward him.[2]  Fourth year  Percy Weasley: "This is no laughing matter!" Fred Weasley: "Oh, get out of the way, Percy. Harry's in a hurry." George: "Yeah, he's nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant!" — George and Fred demonstrate how they find the rumour of Harry being the heir of Slytherin to be ridiculous[src]      Fred, George, and Ron rescue Harry from the Dursleys   In the summer of 1992, Fred, George, and Ron rescued Harry from his relatives' home after not hearing from him during the previous summer month. They pulled the bars off his window and flew him to the Burrow in their father's Ford Anglia. While at the Burrow George and Fred came to know Harry better as they spent time flying with him. The twins soon began their fourth year at Hogwarts, and took to teasing their younger sister Ginny as she began her first year. They were trying to cheer her up, unaware that her emotional state was fragile due to the influence of Tom Riddle's Diary.      Fred, George, and others read the message about the opening of the Chamber of Secrets   That year, the Chamber of Secrets was opened and frightening messages were written on the castle walls. Rumours were circulating that Harry was responsible for it, since he spoke Parseltongue and thus might be the Heir of Slytherin. Neither George nor Fred took these rumours seriously, they found the whole thing laughable and frequently joked about it. They also came to Hermione Granger's defence when Draco Malfoy called her a 'filthy little Mudblood', lunging at him, only to be blocked by Captain Marcus Flint.[7] George helped protect Harry form a rogue Bludger during Gryffindor's opening match against Slytherin. After Gryffindor won the Quidditch match, George went to the hospital wing with the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team to see Harry, because Gilderoy Lockhart had removed all his bones, and congratulated him for his unbelievable flying, but not before seeing Marcus Flint yelling at Draco Malfoy for 'having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing', of which he informed Harry.[7] At the end of the school year, George was relieved when his younger sister was saved — and delighted when she revealed that Percy had a secret girlfriend, as this was another opportunity to take the mickey out of him.[7]      The Weasleys in Egypt   Arthur Weasley had won a large amount of gold from a Ministry contest, something that was both a surprise and delight for the family. The Weasleys used the money won that summer, to take a holiday to Egypt, where the oldest son Bill was working as a Curse Breaker. While there, Fred and George tried to push Percy, who had been acting even more arrogant and pompous than usual because he learned he had been appointed Head Boy, into a pyramid. Their mother stopped them and scolded them severely. They and their brothers went in all the pyramids. They also annoyed Ginny when she couldn't go in the last one, most likely because her their mother thought her too young.[11]  Fifth year  George: "This, Harry, is the secret of our success." Fred Weasley: "It's a wrench, giving it to you, but we decided last night, your need's greater than ours." George: "Anyway, we know it off by heart. We bequeath it to you." — George and Fred giving Harry Potter the Marauder's Map[src]      Fred and George give Harry the Marauder's Map   In 1993, George began his fifth year at Hogwarts. Around Christmas, he and Fred decided to give the Marauder's Map to Harry Potter in order to help him get into Hogsmeade without permission, as they had already memorised it. They also comforted Harry when he was upset by the presence of Dementors at the school that year, and somewhat comforted Ron after his pet rat Scabbers went missing. This was also the year that George and Fred took their Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations, earning three OWLs each.[11] In the summer of 1994, George attended the Quidditch World Cup with his family as well as Harry and Hermione Granger. They gambled on the outcome, and won a great deal of money because of it. However, Ludo Bagman defaulted on the bet. Fred suggested threatening to inform the Ministry of Magic of Bagman's activities, but George was against it, arguing that it was blackmail. That year, George and Fred also started trying out the prank devices they invented, starting with the Ton-Tongue Toffee on Dudley Dursley.[11]  Sixth year  "We thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he'd made a mistake, he'd cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored our letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to get away from us." — George talks about how Ludo Bagman conned him and Fred out of their savings[src]      The 1994 Quidditch World Cup that George attended with his family and friends   Once at school for their sixth year (before their sixth year they attended the Quidditch World Cup with their family), George and Fred began selling, as well as experimenting with, their inventions. That year, Hogwarts also hosted the Triwizard Tournament, which Fred and George both wanted to enter, despite being underage. They attempted to fool the Age Line spell that Albus Dumbledore put around the Goblet of Fire using an Ageing Potion, but the attempt was unsuccessful, though they both thought their beards were uproariously funny.      The Yule Ball that George attended   Later that year, George danced with his chosen partner at the Yule Ball. At the end of the school year, Cedric Diggory, one of the champions, was murdered by Peter Pettigrew on the orders of the newly revived Lord Voldemort, who was reborn.[18] Harry surprised the twins by giving them the one thousand Galleons he won in the Tournament in order for them to start up their joke business. They were extremely grateful, and promised Harry free merchandise.[18]  Seventh year  Molly Weasley: "I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!" George: "What are Fred and I, next-door neighbours?" — George after Ron becomes a Prefect[src]      Fred and George in 12 Grimmauld Place   George spent the summer of 1995 in 12 Grimmauld Place, the headquarters of the newly reconstituted Order of the Phoenix, along with most of his family. He and Fred pocketed Doxies while cleaning up in order to use in their experiments, and spied on Order meetings using their Extendable Ears invention. They had also passed their Apparition tests 'with distinction', and delighted in annoying other inhabitants of the house by frequently Apparating and Disapparating around the house.[10] When Ron and Hermione received news that they were Gryffindor's new Prefects, George was slightly disgruntled by their mother's overjoyed reaction, and he and Fred both taunted Ron over his accomplishment.[10]      Fred and George during a D.A. meeting   Although neither George nor Fred were very concerned about completing their educations, they returned to Hogwarts for their seventh year, and continued to develop and sell their joke products. Hermione managed to stop them from testing out their products on younger students after threatening to tell their mother that they had been tricking first-years into trying out treats from the Skiving Snackboxes, a threat George considered 'below the belt'. George and Fred also joined Dumbledore's Army. They greatly disliked the new Ministry appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor and High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge and wanted to oppose Ministry control at Hogwarts, as well as prepare to fight Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.[10] Later in the year, Umbridge kicked George, Fred, and Harry off the Gryffindor Quidditch team and gave them all lifetime bans from Quidditch after George and Harry got into a fight with Draco Malfoy (although their bans were lifted immediately when Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts).[10] The Slytherins had written the lyrics to the demeaning song Weasley is Our King, intended to humiliate Ron and undermine the Gryffindor team, and then insulted George's parents and Harry's late mother. Things would get worse for George and his family around Christmas, when their father was attacked by Nagini, Voldemort's snake. The Weasleys split their Christmas holidays between Order headquarters and St Mungo's, although Percy did not visit and sent the jumper his mother sent him back unopened, continuing his estrangement.[10]      Fred and George during their escape from Hogwarts   Later in the school year, the D.A. was discovered, but Albus Dumbledore took the blame and left Hogwarts. George and Fred decided that they no longer cared about getting into trouble, and started an all-out rebellion against Umbridge. They shoved Inquisitorial Squad member Graham Montague into a Vanishing Cabinet when he attempted to dock House Points from them, set off a spectacular array of fireworks of their own making, and created a Portable Swamp in a corridor.[10] In a flourish of vandalism and chaos, George and Fred flew away from Hogwarts, encouraging other students and Peeves to follow their examples.[10]  Career as a shop proprietor (1996–1997) Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes  Fred Weasley: "We've just developed this more serious line. Funny how it happened..." George: "You wouldn't believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can't do a decent Shield Charm... And then we thought we'd get into the whole area of Defence Against the Dark Arts, because it's such a money spinner." — A new line of more serious products revolving around defensive magic[src]      The inside of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes   Initially, Fred and George's ambitions to open a joke shop came as a disappointment to their parents, who had hoped they would seek employment with the Ministry of Magic like their father.[10] However, the spectacular success of the twins' business, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, located at 93 Diagon Alley, immensely impressed his parents and made them proud.[14] What had started out as a mail-order experiment[10] in entrepreneurialism skyrocketed into a very lucrative undertaking.[14] It was so successful, in fact, that in 1996, the twins had moved out of their childhood home and into a flat above the store.[14] Later, the twins considered buying Zonko's Joke Shop in Hogsmeade, which had closed the previous year.[14]      Fred and George standing in their new store   None of this might have been possible without the funding Harry Potter had given them in 1995.[18] For Harry's generosity, the twins allowed him to take any merchandise free of charge. In the summer of 1996, Harry, Ron, and Hermione Granger visited the shop and Fred showed Harry around. He also offered Hermione a Patented Daydream Charm for free after she called them 'extraordinary magic', but still charged Ron for his purchases. Fred and George also questioned Ginny on her love life, much to her irritation.[14] That Christmas, the twins stayed at the Burrow for the holidays. When Percy arrived with Minister Rufus Scrimgeour and it became clear that the two had only come so that the Minister could question Harry. George threw mashed parsnips at his older brother, along with Fred and Ginny, causing Percy to leave.[14]      Fred and George stay at the Burrow for Christmas   When Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, as well as their parents and a few of their siblings visited their shop in the summer of 1996, the place was described as 'packed with customers' to a degree that it was extremely difficult to get near the shelves. Fred and George had also created a Defence Against the Dark Arts line of products, such as 'Shield Hats' and 'Shield Cloaks' that were widely purchased by the Ministry for its staff.[14] Throughout the school year of 1996 to 1997, the twins were able to disguise products to be sent into Hogwarts by mail order (even though all their merchandise was banned by Argus Filch) to the students. One of their services was to have their own line of Love Potion to be disguised as perfume bottles. They also bred magical animals such as Pygmy Puffs, which were miniature Puffskeins.[14]  Order of the Phoenix (1997–1998) Battle of the Seven Potters  George: "Saintlike... I'm holey. I'm holey Fred, ya geddit?" Fred Weasley: "With the whole wide world of ear-related humour, you go for 'I'm holey'. Pathetic." George: "Reckon I'm still better looking than you." — George joking about losing his ear in the battle[src]      George after losing his ear in the sky battle   As supporters of Albus Dumbledore, George and Fred both joined the Order of the Phoenix once they were of age. They participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters, along with their father and their younger brother Ron. Fred and George took Polyjuice Potion to become one of the 'seven Potters'. While in Privet Drive they also tried numerous times to lighten the mood.  Once in the air a large group of Death Eaters attacked the Order members and their charges, this led to a massive sky battle. George flew with Remus Lupin on a broomstick and lost an ear due to an off-target Sectumsempra spell fired by Severus Snape.[9] There was nothing that could be done about George's ear, as it had been cursed off with Dark magic. However, he took this optimistically, and turned it into a joke, calling himself 'holey' and also saying his mother would now be able to tell the difference between them.[9] George had the option of replacing his ear with a prosthetic false ear but chose not to.[25]  Wedding of Bill and Fleur     Bill and Fleur's wedding day   That same summer, Fred and George eagerly flirted with two 'pretty French girls', who came to the Burrow to attend their brother Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour. It is possible that these girls might have been related to Fleur. Fred also reminisced about his late uncle Bilius, to the entertainment of George, Ron, Harry, and Hermione.[26] Discussing how Billius used to down a whole bottle of Firewhiskey, go out on to the dance floor left up his robes and pull out bunches of flowers. It is unknown whether or not George was still present at the wedding when Death Eaters stormed the wedding looking for Harry Potter.  Potterwatch  "Point is, people, don't get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he's out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn't, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don't count on him being a long way away if you're planning to take any risks. I never thought I'd hear myself say it, but safety first!" — Fred reporting on Voldemort's movements on Potterwatch[src]  When the war reached its worst point in late 1997 and 1998, George participated under the code names 'Rodent' and later 'Rapier' in Potterwatch, a radio programme hosted by his friend Lee that opposed Voldemort's reign of terror. They spread the truth about the Death Eater regime that was not being reported by the Daily Prophet or other news outlets, and encouraged the public to support Harry Potter and to protect Muggles and wizards alike who were falling victim to the Death Eaters.[9]  Battle of Hogwarts  "Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan..." — George duelling during the second half of the battle[src]      George with Fred before the battle begins   Later in the war, he and his family friends returned to Hogwarts to fight the invading Death Eater army; he and Fred were placed in charge of the defence of the castle's secret passages by Kingsley Shacklebolt. Fred was killed in an explosion while fighting alongside his brother Percy, which deeply devastated George.[9] George and Lee Jordan were later seen defeating Yaxley.[9] George also saw Harry Potter defeat Lord Voldemort, thus ending the war.[9]  Later life (1998–?)  "In the immediate aftermath of the battle Weasley, whose famous ginger hair appears to be thinning slightly, entered into employment with the Ministry of Magic alongside Potter, but left only two years later to co-manage the highly successful wizarding joke emporium Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Was he, as he stated at the time, 'delighted to assist my brother George with a business I've always loved'?" — DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL[src]      George with his family after the Battle   George never truly got over Fred's death. He eventually married Angelina Johnson, and named his first child Fred in loving memory of the twin brother he lost during the final battle.[8] The couple also had a daughter named Roxanne.[8] George continued to run Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes to great success; his younger brother Ron retired from being an Auror after two years and helped him to turn the shop into a real money-spinner,[8] to the point where their Puking Pastille became considered contraband in most work environments in the magical community, and even more impressive; George went on to become highly regarded as 'the bane of many a professor', and went on to become well-beloved by students at various schools throughout the wizarding world.[27] During the Calamity, George would meet a member of the responding Statute of Secrecy Task Force in the Leaky Cauldron and discussed his affinity for Pyrotechnics with them, resulting in their power increasing when having cast a critical blow.  Physical appearance George, like the other members of the Weasley family, sported flaming-red hair and freckles, and was shorter than his brothers Bill, Percy, and Ron, and somewhat stocky, like his brothers Fred and Charlie. However, he was still fairly tall, as he is mentioned as being taller than Harry Potter.[28] As a result of an injury from Severus Snape's Sectumsempra during the Battle of the Seven Potters, George has lost one of his ears, briefly distinguishing him from his identical twin until Fred's death.[9]  Personality and traits  George: "What made you see sense, Perce?" Percy Weasley: "It's been coming for a while... I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am." George: "Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these. Now let's get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death Eaters'll be taken." — George upon reconciling with Percy during the Battle of Hogwarts[src]  George was the quieter, gentler of the twins,[29] George's sense of humour was not harsh, and he was inclined to make fun of himself on occasion as well — even when he was injured and lost an ear.[9] He also appeared to be slightly more moral, as he was against blackmailing Ludo Bagman when the former Quidditch player defaulted on a bet at the Quidditch World Cup.[18] However, he still displayed a slight vindictive streak when it came to dealing with people he loathed; for example, he and his brother Fred had absolutely no compunction in forcing Graham Montague into a Vanishing Cabinet, an act which nearly killed him, according to Draco Malfoy. When Draco Malfoy insulted his parents and Harry's mother due to his team losing the Quidditch match, both he and Harry gave him a severe beating and was not at all remorseful of doing it.      Fred and George's antics before they try to cross the Age Line   George's prankster nature was enjoyed by nearly everyone in his family, aside from his brother Percy and his mother, who both considered jokes to be immature and childish. However, his pranks targeted at Percy were usually good-natured, and the only thing that got hurt was Percy's pride. He and Fred particularly enjoyed teasing Percy and their younger brother Ron,[7] while they were especially close to their sister Ginny, who was similar to them in temperament.[14] However, they were protective of their siblings, and eventually extended this familial protectiveness towards Ron's friends Harry Potter and Hermione Granger (who later became their in-laws). Both he and Fred were renowned for their senses of humour; they were able to make people laugh and relax even in very trying times. Neither George nor Fred took school very seriously, but they were both very talented wizards, and demonstrated their ingenuity in their inventions and their business sense in running a highly lucrative shop. They were also staunchly loyal to their loved ones and very brave, (as evidenced by their been sorted into Gryffindor) and unafraid to stand up against what they thought was wrong, whether it was Dolores Umbridge's tyranny at Hogwarts or Death Eaters.  Magical abilities and skills  "E for Exceeds Expectations. And I've always thought Fred and I should've got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams." — George Weasley[src]  Although not a high achiever academically, George was a very clever, talented, and creative wizard. In fact, he and Fred once attempted, before being of age to go to Hogwarts, to cast an advanced spell like the Unbreakable Vow with their younger sibling Ron (and would have succeeded if their father had not discovered the attempt). Harry Potter once expressed bewilderment as to how he and Fred received only three O.W.L.s each, remarking that they 'really know their stuff'. When the twins turned seventeen, they were able to use magic outside of Hogwarts, and took full advantage of this. They did everything by magic and frequently Apparated around 12 Grimmauld Place and the Burrow, much to their mother's irritation.[10]   "A lot of wizards think it's a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick, but we feel they're skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow." — Fred Weasley on lock picking[src]  Muggle tricks: Despite being pure-bloods and raised entirely in the wizarding world, Fred and George recognised the usefulness of certain Muggle abilities, and mastered several skills that they found amusing or useful, such as lock picking.[7] As such, they launched a line of Muggle tricks in their shop, 'for freaks like Dad', according to Fred, even though it was not much of a seller.[14] This may have been influenced by their father, Arthur Weasley, who was very interested into Muggles. This also demonstrates Fred and George's ingenuity, as not many people born into the magical world are familiar with Muggle devices or skills.  "We've got two unbeatable Beaters." — Oliver Wood on Fred and George[src]  Flying: George was a highly talented Beater for the Gryffindor Quidditch team since his second year. Oliver Wood described the twins as 'unbeatable'[18] and Harry Potter thought that they flew like two 'human Bludgers'.[2] George was an excellent flyer with highly precise aim. After the twins left Hogwarts, Harry lamented that he was never able to find replacements as talented as they were for the team.[14]  "...it was a good bit of magic." — Filius Flitwick on the twins' Portable Swamp[src]      Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-bangs, one of Fred and George's many inventions   Charms: One of the few O.W.L.s George bothered to achieve was in Charms,[30] a subject he and Fred were extremely talented in. Their skilled spellwork was necessary for many of their magical inventions for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Charms professor Filius Flitwick was so impressed by their Portable Swamp that he left a portion of it intact within Hogwarts.[10] Furthermore, George was able to produce a fully corporeal Patronus in the form of a Magpie,[13] which is proof of his superior talent and proficiency in charm-work given the immense difficulty of performing such an advanced and powerful protective charm.  "How do those hats work then? I mean, obviously it's some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object..." — Hermione Granger's interest in Fred and George's Headless Hats[src]      The Portable Swamp, invention of Fred and George's that Filius Flitwick found impressive   Magical device invention: George was very talented with the creation of original magical objects. Along with Fred, George invented a wide variety of items for their shop. Some notable items include Extendable Ears, which can be used to spy on others, a series of sickness-inducing sweets,[10] and Patented Daydream Charms, which Hermione Granger considered to be 'extraordinary magic'. The twins also invented items for Defence Against the Dark Arts rather than pranks, such as Decoy Detonators and Shield Hats; the latter were purchased by the Ministry of Magic itself for its employees as a protection method during the Second Wizarding War.[14]  "...Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny..." — Ron Weasley on Fred and George's performance at school[src]  Herbology: Along with Fred, George was talented in Herbology. He took the subject in his sixth and seventh year as well. George, along with Fred were both capable of experimenting with Venomous Tentacula seeds in the production of several of their Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes,[10] showing his skill in the subject. Potions: Along with Fred, George was very skilled at brewing and inventing potions. He and Fred invented many love potions as part of their WonderWitch line of products, showing his proficiency in potion-making, as love potions are notably advanced brews.[14] Transfiguration: George was skilled in the field of transfiguration; it was one of the few O.W.L.s George ever tried to achieve.[31]  "You wouldn't believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can't do a decent Shield Charm... And then we thought we'd get into the whole area of Defence Against the Dark Arts, because it's such a money spinner." — Fred and George's success in their Defence Against the Dark Arts products[src]  Defence Against the Dark Arts: George was highly skilled at Defence Against the Dark Arts; he achieved an O.W.L. in it and further improved his skills in Dumbledore's Army.[32] George's talent at defence would contribute to his ability to invent protective items with Fred such as Decoy Detonators, and to obtain rare and useful defensive items such as Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.[14] The twins also joined the Order of the Phoenix at a young age, and participated in a number of its operations. He fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters, during which he lost an ear by Severus Snape; however, Snape was aiming at a Death Eater. George also fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, during which he was in charge of guarding the school passages, along with Fred.[9] Duelling: George was a highly skilled and talented duellist who along with Lee Jordan defeated the Death Eater Yaxley, during the Battle of Hogwarts. He also fought in Battle of the Seven Potters where he lost his ear. He survived the Battle of Hogwarts and the war, showing his excellent abilities in martial magic.[9]  "– or we can ask Fred and George, they know every secret passage out of the castle –" — Ron Weasley[src]  Hogwarts secret passageways expert: Ever since the twins swiped the Marauder's Map from Argus Filch's office,[11] they had a great knowledge of all of Hogwarts grounds including the secret passageways. Fred even once commented that the Map had taught him more at school than the professors had. The twins' knowledge of the grounds were second only to the Marauders. They seemed to have memorised the Map entirely, as they gave it to Harry in his third year and still remembered everything. This knowledge allowed George to tell Hermione Granger where the Hogwarts kitchens were,[18] and for him and Fred to lead the defence of the school's secret passages during the Battle of Hogwarts.[9]  Ron Weasley: "It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs." Fred Weasley: "Time is Galleons, little brother." — Ron and Fred after the latter passed his Apparition test[src]  Apparition: Fred and George managed to pass their Apparition tests sometime prior to their final year in Hogwarts, apparently 'with distinction'. To celebrate their coming of age of being allowed to use magic outside of school, as well as making travelling a close distance easier, they both took to Apparating as often as possible, even over very short distances.[10] Business: As George co-owned Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes alongside his brother Fred after leaving Hogwarts, his business skills were quite good, especially as they were able to operate it through Owl Orders before they purchased the main property at Diagon Alley, and when they were on the run before the Battle of Hogwarts. After Fred's death, George continued to operate the business alongside his younger brother Ron, turning it into a bigger 'money-spinner'.[14] Possessions     George's wand   Wand: The wood and core of George's wand was unknown. Most likely, this wand was bought second-hand, as are most of the Weasley possessions. Assuming that it was bought at the age of eleven, before beginning their education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it would've been purchased in 1989. It is probable that George's wand was more suitable for Transfiguration work, because of his choice in subjects.[33]  "This little beauty's taught us more than all the teachers in this school." — Fred on the Marauder's Map[src]  Marauder's Map: Along with Fred, George 'nicked' the Marauder's Map from a drawer in Filch's office, during their first year.[11] Sometime between then and 1993, he and Fred figured out how to unlock and erase the Map.[11] He used the map ever since until 1993, when he gave the map to Harry Potter in order to help him sneak into Hogsmeade.[11]     The Cleansweep Fives   Cleansweep Five: George and his twin each flew on a Cleansweep Five broomstick when they played as Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.[7] Their use of such outdated broomsticks was likely due to their family's financial problems.[7] Despite this, the twins are still very skilled in flying and as Beaters.[2] Draco Malfoy, 'who could always afford the best,' insulted Fred and George's vintage brooms by saying that a museum would bid for them.[7] Their brooms, along with Harry Potter's, were confiscated by Dolores Umbridge when they assaulted Malfoy for insulting their families.[10] After the twins released a Portable Swamp in defiance to the woman, they used a Summoning Charm to retrieve their brooms from her office, and used them to fly out of Hogwarts as a final act of rebellion.[10] The broomsticks created two rather large holes in Umbridge's door.[10] Prank and joke items: Including the items that he had already made, George owned a large collection of joke items that he had bought from Zonko's Joke Shop to help with their own development and enjoyment for pranks.[2] These include Dungbombs, Dr Filibuster's Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks and Stink Pellets.[2] Relationships Family members Weasley family     Fred Weasley, his twin   Fred Weasley was George's twin, best friend, and partner in crime. They were as close as two brothers could ever be. The two would always agree with one another, and never get into any fights or arguments, (at least not real ones.) The two did just about everything together. They often finished each other's sentences and spoke in a back and forth way that could confuse others at times. They were trouble makers, often pranking their siblings, particularly Ron and Percy, and even sold pranking charms and spells in the boys bathroom. Together, Fred and George designed many ingenious pranks and shared the ambition to found a joke shop together. They were also both Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team and close friends with Lee Jordan. George was devastated by the death of his twin in the Battle of Hogwarts, and would never truly get over this loss. He eventually named his son after Fred.       The Weasley family   Like his younger siblings, George tended to look up to his older brothers Bill and Charlie. However, he and Fred delighted in teasing Percy, who was closer to their age and rather stuffy.[7] George was furious with Percy when he fell out with the family over their father's support of Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter instead of the Ministry, but the family reconciled just before the Battle of Hogwarts began when Percy apologised for his mistakes.  George and Fred also enjoyed teasing their only younger brother, Ron. Ron's phobia of spiders derives from a prank the twins played on him when he was young.In Ron's first year, George teased his younger brother by teaching him a fabricated spell, which in turn led Ron to get embarrassed in front of his friends Harry Potter and Hermione Granger.   "Sunshine, daisies,butter mellow,turn this stupid,fat rat yellow." — Ron Weasley casting the fake spell, taught to him by George Weasley[src]  They also teased him over things such as his embarrassing crush on Fleur Delacour. After Fred's death, Ron helped George run the joke shop for a time. George was quite close to his sister Ginny, who was similar to the twins in temperament and also liked to tease Ron. They were protective of her, as well, often disapproving of her love life. Like most members of the Weasley family, George got on well with his parents. He along with Fred was furious when Draco insulted them and when Harry's mother was insulted too, causing him to let go of George, George proceeded to beat up Malfoy along with Harry and did not regret it even when he was banned from being a Beater at Hogwarts for life. Mrs Weasley was often unhappy with the twins' lack of seriousness and commitment to his learning. She was unhappy with both their earning of only three O.W.L.s and desire to own a joke shop. Mrs Weasley was very upset when she first saw George's cut ear, and thanked Remus Lupin, who saved George from Death Eaters. Mr Weasley was more laid back than his wife. While not overly supportive of George and Fred's wrongdoing, he seemed to encourage the trying of new things. Mr Weasley was excited when informed of George's adventure rescuing Harry Potter from the Dursleys and only pretended to be strict. He was upset by George's injuries after the Battle of the Seven Potters, but also very glad that George survived the battle. After the war, Mr and Mrs Weasley had two grandchildren through George and his wife, Angelina Johnson.  Harry Potter  "The Marauder's Map was, however, of immense use to the young Weasley twins... It was a mark of their high esteem for Harry Potter, and their belief that he stood in need of assistance with a destiny none of them yet fully understood, that they later gifted the map to him, unwittingly passing it on to the child of one of the creators." — Fred and George giving Harry the Marauder's Map[src]     Harry Potter, his schoolmate and future brother-in-law   George first met Harry Potter in his third year at Hogwarts, when Harry was beginning his first year and became friends with Ron. The twins became friendly with him when he joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team as their Seeker, giving them hope to win the House Cup.  The following year, George and Fred cheered Harry up when many of the students believed that he might be the Heir of Slytherin, which they scoffed at, and the year after that, they gave him the Marauder's Map to help him sneak into Hogsmeade. The twins also stood up for Harry when others doubted his claim that Lord Voldemort had returned or challenged his authority in Dumbledore's Army, and assisted him in contacting Sirius Black when he told them and Ginny of his desire to speak to his godfather. Both twins risked their lives in the operation to remove Harry from his relatives' home in 1997. They seemed to regard Harry almost as another younger sibling, and were inclined to both be both protective and teasing of him. Harry was very upset by George's injuries after the Battle of the Seven Potters. He eventually became George's brother-in-law through his marriage to Ginny.  Hermione Granger     Hermione Granger, his friend and future sister-in-law   George became friendly with Hermione Granger after she became a close friend to his younger brother Ron. Although Hermione disapproved of some of the twins' antics, since she was a Prefect, she generally got on fairly well with them. They seem to regard Hermione as somewhat of a sister due to her close relationship with Ron and the fact that she stayed at the Weasley's mutliple times during the holidays. They were outraged when Draco Malfoy called her a 'Mudblood' in 1992, to the point of attempting to physically attack him. Hermione also warned Fred and his twin brother that their Ageing Potion wouldn't trick the age line protecting the Goblet of Fire due to the fact that Dumbledore would have thought of a foolish ageing potion in advance. They found out she was right when they were blown backwards and grew long, white beards. George and Fred also tried to get Hermione to relax, joking around with her about things such as their late uncle Bilius's penchant for making mischief at weddings. Hermione also admired the twins' cleverness and creativity in their spell work, once remarking that they could do some 'extraordinary magic', though she did not agree with how they put it to use. George also admired Hermione's magical talents and even bet on her beating Ron in a dual during training for Dumbledore's Army. Hermione was also one of the few people willing to stand up to the twins when she disagreed with them. For example, when she caught them testing sweets from the Skiving Snackbox on first-year students with Lee Jordan, she was furious, and told them off for what she considered taking advantage of innocent children. George and Fred initially scoffed at her concerns and at her ability to make them stop, but backed down when she threatened to tell their mother. However, the twins did not seem to hold a grudge, as they continued to be friendly. Hermione would eventually become George's sister-in-law through her marriage to Ron.  Angelina Johnson     Angelina Johnson, his wife and mother of his children   George was friendly with Angelina Johnson, a Gryffindor in his year and fellow Quidditch player, during their school years. She attended the Yule Ball with his twin brother Fred in 1994. After Fred's death and the end of the Second Wizarding War, she and George evidently grew closer, and eventually married and had two children together. One of the children was named after George's late twin.  Children After the Second Wizarding War, George married Angelina Johnson and together they had two children; Fred, who was named after his late twin brother, and Roxanne. George possibly had a good relationship with his children, and joked in front of them, as Ron did to his children.  Nieces and nephews George had also several nieces and nephews through his siblings: Victoire, Dominique and Louis, Bill and Fleur's children; Molly and Lucy, Percy and his wife, Audrey's children; Rose and Hugo, Ron and Hermione's children; James, Albus and Lily, Ginny and Harry's children. It is supposed that George had a good relationship with his nieces and nephews, and that they liked him. James also appeared to act like George, because they both enjoyed pulling pranks and teasing their siblings.    Minerva McGonagall     Minerva McGonagall, his previous professor   Minerva McGonagall was the Transfiguration teacher during George and his brother, Fred's years at Hogwarts. Although McGonagall was always well known for being strict and stern, she was never shown punishing or even telling off Fred and George for their wild behaviour and many pranks. It was known however that they were good Quidditch players from a good family, and she was visibly displeased with having the twins and Harry kicked off the Gryffindor Quidditch team. McGonagall often perceived the twins as naughty but seemed to share their dislike of Dolores Umbridge, who was the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for a small time. McGonagall did not attempt to remove the fireworks that surfaced around the school causing great disruptions. When George made his legendary escape in 1996, McGonagall assisted Peeves to unscrew an overhead chandelier, in an obvious homage to Fred and George.  Lee Jordan     Lee Jordan, his good friend   Lee Jordan was best friends with Fred and George during his time at Hogwarts, and often got into trouble along with them. In 1995 he joined Dumbledore's Army and helped the twins harass Dolores Umbridge, one incident of which resulted in him being punished by 'writing lines', scarring his hand. Lee Jordan also attended Fleur and Bill Weasley's wedding, and danced with Ginny Weasley in 1997. On 2 May 1998, Lee returned with Fred and George to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. After Fred's death, George and Lee both defeated the Death Eater Yaxley.  Hogwarts staff     Filius Flitwick, his previous professor   Fred and George had a good relationship with most Hogwarts professors. Professor Filius Flitwick, the Charms professor, seemed to like them; he was very happy by their spell work. He also thought that they were very talented wizards, and started to support them, becoming against Dolores Umbridge in 1995.  When Fred and George set off fireworks around the ground she spent a day running around putting them out. After she had done Flitwick's classroom, he told her that he could have put them all out easily but was concerned he didn't have the authority to do so. After Easter break, the twins used one of their inventions, a Portable Swamp to change a corridor into a swamp and then shortly afterwards they departed from school to go into the world of business. Flitwick was seen cheering and supporting them at their departure after they ran rings around Umbridge and Filch.  Flitwick was asked to remove the swamp they created, which he did but left a small patch in the corner as he believed it to be really good magic.      Rubeus Hagrid, his friend and previous professor   Fred and George were friends with Rubeus Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures professor, during their time at Hogwarts. Hagrid seemed to be one of their favourite members of the staff, as he was not too serious, unlike many other professors. They were also among the few people who believed that Hagrid was a great person even after they learned that he was a half-giant. Hagrid also thought that Fred and George were trouble-makers, but very funny. He once compared them with Harry Potter's deceased father James and his best friend Sirius Black. Furthermore, they were all among Harry Potter's closest friends. Fred and George fought in the Second Wizarding War along with Hagrid. However, Fred was killed in the Battle of Hogwarts, during an explosion. It is possible that Hagrid was very sad when he learned about that.      Albus Dumbledore, his previous headmaster   Both Fred and George appeared to like the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and thought that he was the greatest wizard of all time. He seemed to like them, too, despite that they were trouble-makers, and he knew they were good persons. Along with his twin, George joined the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation founded by Dumbledore, in order to oppose Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters as well as Dumbledore's Army to oppose Dolores Umbridge and the Ministry of Magic. Fred and George both showed loyalty to Dumbledore by punishing Umbridge after Umbridge became headmistress.      Severus Snape, his previous professor and enemy   Fred and George disliked Severus Snape the potions master. Snape disliked them, too. This could be because of the fact that the Weasley twins were trouble-makers, like Snape's schoolboy rivals the Marauders, especially James Potter I and Sirius Black. Snape was eventually charged with being Death Eater; however, he was a double agent and working for the Order of the Phoenix. He accidentally hit George with a Sectumsempra, while aiming at a Death Eater during the Battle of the Seven Potters. George possibly learned that Snape was on their side during the Battle of Hogwarts.      Argus Filch, an enemy   The twins also disliked Argus Filch, the caretaker. Filch had punished them many times during their Hogwarts years, because they were trouble-makers. Fred and George also 'nicked' the Marauder's Map from Filch, while they were in his office. Filch also had a great knowledge of all Hogwarts' secret passages, only less than Fred and George's. When Dolores Umbridge was appointed at Hogwarts, Filch supported her, and tried to punish the twins again.      Dolores Umbridge, his previous DADA professor and enemy   Fred and George hated Dolores Umbridge, who was appointed by the Ministry of Magic as the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in 1995. Umbridge was a sadistic woman who enjoyed punishing and torturing students. Almost every resident of Hogwarts at the time hated Umbridge, but she particularly hated Harry Potter and Fred and George. When George and Harry attacked Draco Malfoy, Umbridge kicked them off the team, along with Fred (although their bans were lifted immediately following Umbridge's removal from the school). Fred and George were the ones who opposed Umbridge. They also created a Portable Swamp, in order to anger Umbridge. When she attempted to punish them, Fred and George insulted her in front of the whole school and then fled with their broomsticks. After the war, Umbridge was imprisoned in Azkaban, for her crimes against muggle-borns.  Dumbledore's Army     Dumbledore's Army, his alias   In 1995, George and Fred joined Dumbledore's Army, an organisation founded and led by Harry Potter, in order to oppose Dolores Umbridge and teach Defence Against the Dark Arts to the other students. The twins knew most of them, and they had a good relationship with most members of the army, including Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley, Lee Jordan and Angelina Johnson. Some members of the army were also members of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, including Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell. The girls appeared to be close with George, whom they possibly knew since their first year, as well as his brother, Fred. Both of them were very upset when Umbridge kicked Harry and the twins off the team. George met them again when they fought at the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998 and they possibly survived the war. Other members of the army were Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Lavender Brown, Parvati and Padma Patil, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Susan Bones, Cho Chang, Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, Terry Boot, Marietta Edgecombe and Zacharias Smith. George was friendly with them, although not very close; however, he disliked Zacharias Smith, who didn't believe that Voldemort had returned, and did not fight at the Battle of Hogwarts, as did Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the army to Umbridge. However, the rest of them fought for Dumbledore's Army, and at least one of them, Colin Creevey, was killed by Death Eaters.  The Marauders  "Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. We owe them so much." — George's appreciation for the Marauders[src]      James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew   George and his brother Fred regarded the Marauders with a kind of idolatry and they believed that they owed a lot to them, as their invention, the Marauder's Map, helped them to achieve a lot of their aims. Although they owned the map for many years, they did not refer to them as the Marauders, but instead they called them by their nicknames: Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.  While they were in possession of the map, the twins did not, however, work out that two of the Marauders were two of their friends in the Order of the Phoenix: Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. Neither were they aware that Prongs was in fact Harry's father, James, and that Wormtail was actually Death Eater Peter Pettigrew. He and Fred were both friends of Sirius Black after they both learnt of his innocence. Sirius was friendly with them, but he argued with the twins (for example: when he told them to wait at home while their father was in danger). Sirius was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996. The twins were saddened by his death, but tried not to remind Harry about it. They were also friends of Remus Lupin, whom they first met in 1993, when he was Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. They considered him among the best teachers of this lesson they had ever had. Lupin fought with the twins in many battles of the Second War, and was killed in the final battle, along with Fred. Their bodies were put near each other's in the Great Hall. It is unknown if the twins ever learnt the true identities of the Marauders, although it is possible they did eventually learn the truth after Voldemort's return considering that Sirius mentioned Pettigrew's nickname Wormtail in front of them while explaining Voldemort's intentions to them without them questioning that. It is also unknown if Lupin and Sirius ever learnt that the twins both had the Marauders Map in their possession during their time in Hogwarts.  Order of the Phoenix     The original Order of the Phoenix, his alias   George also became a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the Second Wizarding War. The Order was an organisation led by Albus Dumbledore in order to fight Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. George had a good relationship with most members of the order. Some notable relationships include Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, his other family members (excluding Percy who had fallen out with the other Weasleys, and Ginny who was underage) and some of the Hogwarts professors. Another member of the Order that they knew was Nymphadora Tonks. Tonks and the twins were close in age, and they were friendly. They fought together in the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts.Tonks was killed during the final battle, too. Her body was put near Fred's, as well as Lupin's, after their death. The twins also knew Alastor Moody and Kingsley Shacklebolt. They appeared to have a good relationship, although they were not very close. When Moody was killed by Voldemort, everyone was sad. Before the twins learned about it, they were joking with each other. They immediately stopped talking once they heard Moody died, and their expressions immediately switched to sadness. Kingsley survived the war and became Minister for Magic.  Media Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Clip) Harry escapes the Dursley'sRescuing Harry Etymology George is a popular male given name derived from the Greek word γεωργος (georgos), meaning 'farmer' or 'earthworker'. Saint George was a third-century martyr who became a patron saint of England after the Crusades. Six kings of Britain have borne the name George. Other famous bearers include the composer George Frideric Händel, first American president George Washington, two kings of Greece, and explorer George Vancouver. It was also the pen name of English writers George Eliot and George Orwell.[34] J. K. Rowling has stated that she chose the name for liking and and finding it fitting with the 'old-fashioned' theme of the other Weasley brothers.[35]  Behind the scenes     George Weasley as a LEGO minifigure      George Weasley as a POP! Vinyl       George Weasley (in his Yule Ball robes) as a POP! Vinyl   George is portrayed by British actor Oliver Phelps in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2 and so is one of the 13 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations. There has been some suggestion that George and Fred are named after their maternal uncles, Fabian and Gideon Prewett, who were killed in the First Wizarding War, and who share George and Fred's first initials. It is possible that he and Fred were the basis for Kaoru and Hikaru Hitachiin, a pair of mischievous, red-haired twins from the shojo manga, 'Ouran Highschool Host Club.' Daniel Radcliffe plays George in the 'Seven Potters' scene. George and Fred earned fewer O.W.Ls combined than each of the rest of their brothers separately. George and Fred were the only sons of Arthur and Molly Weasley who did not become prefects during their education at Hogwarts. In the novels, J. K. Rowling described the twins as 'shorter and stockier' and Percy and Ron as 'long and lanky', but in the film, Fred and George were a lot taller and lankier than Percy and Ron. George Weasley's O.W.L. results have not been specifically stated by name; he had mentioned in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that he had an inspected Charms lesson, and that he and his brother Fred were going to sell extendable ears before Herbology. Lee Jordan also mentioned that they played Exploding Snap in Defence Against the Dark Arts. Since they only passed three subjects, these are most likely the subjects they passed (although it is also possible that the twins chose different subjects to take beyond OWL level and purposely failed other courses to free up their schedules). Rowling has said that George and Fred are among her favourite characters.[36] Unlike Ron, his younger brother, George never got mad at Harry Potter for dating and romancing with George's sister, Ginny. However, George was protective of Ginny. The Weasley twins were born April Fools' Day - April 1. It's traditional to play a prank on someone on this day, which seems to be a particular hobby of Fred and George's. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 it is George who walks in on Harry and Ginny kissing in the kitchen on Harry's birthday, instead of Ron bursting in on them in Ginny's bedroom. It is interesting to note that the only times Fred or George have been injured were when they were apart. They were split up at the time of Fred's death and when George lost his ear. Unsurprisingly, losing his ear barely affected George at all, joking only minutes after having it cut off. By the morning he's even using his ear as a place to hold things. In the book, George's ear is removed completely, leaving a hole where it used to be. In the film, his ear isn't removed, but it is heavily scarred and deformed. Author's comments J. K. Rowling described Fred and George as 'the risk-takers in the family... who just take a totally different life path and were prepared to risk everything'.[37] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 68 images related to George Weasley.
