Going to be any more showers of owls, tonight, Jim?""Well, Ted, I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight." — Ted and Jim McGuffin[src]  Jim McGuffin was a Muggle television weatherman in 1981, working alongside Ted. McGuffin had predicted rain for November 1st, but due to the downfall of Lord Voldemort and celebrations by the Wizarding community, his forecasted rain became shooting stars across some areas of Great Britain. Obviously unaware of the true reason, McGuffin wondered on air if people had been celebrating Bonfire Night early. Vernon Dursley watched the broadcast, prompting him to ask his wife, Petunia, if the peculiar weather had anything to do with her sister's "people."[1]  Behind the scenes In fiction, a MacGuffin (sometimes McGuffin or maguffin) is a plot device in the form of some goal, desired object, or other motivator that the protagonist pursues, often with little or no narrative explanation. The specific nature of a MacGuffin is typically unimportant to the overall plot. The most common type of MacGuffin is a person, place, or thing (such as money or an object of value). Other more abstract types include victory, glory, survival, power, love, or some unexplained driving force.[2] Appearances Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 1 (The Boy Who Lived)  ↑ MacGuffin on Wikipedia              Categories         Categories:   British individuals    Journalists    Males    Meteorologists    Muggles             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Italiano Polski Português do Brasil      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
