Mylor Silvanus   Physical information  Species Human[1]   Gender Male[1]   [Source]  Mylor Silvanus was a wizard.[1]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology According to legend, Saint Melor (called Mylor in Cornish) was a prince of Brittany whose uncle Rivod murdered his father to seize the throne and first maimed Melor, cutting off his right hand and left foot, but when Melor's prosthetic limbs began working like natural ones, Rivod sent an assassin to kill him. Veneration of Melor spread from Brittany to Cornwall where he has several churches dedicated to him. Silvanus was derived from the Latin silva, "forest", and was the name of the Roman god of woods.[2]  Behind the scenes Mylor Silvanus was one of two names which J. K. Rowling considered giving to the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in Harry Potter's fifth year at the time she was still planning Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.[1] The name "Silvanus" was later used as the given name of Silvanus Kettleburn, professor of Care of Magical Creatures.
