Ptolemy   Physical information  Species Human   Gender Male   Hair colour Grey[1]   Skin colour Light[1]   [Source]  Ptolemy was a famous wizard.[2] He was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card at some point by 1989.[3]  Contents  1 History 2 Behind the scenes 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   History By 1 September 1991, his Chocolate Frog Card was one of two that Ron Weasley had yet to collect (the other being Cornelius Agrippa).[2]  Behind the scenes There are several historical figures who bore the name Ptolemy, the most famous being Claudius Ptolemaeus (c. 90 AD – c. 168 AD), a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and astrologer who lived in Egypt while it was under Roman rule. Another famous historic figure was Ptolemy I, who was one of Alexander the Great's generals. He was the first Pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Despite being mentioned in the first novel, Ptolemy's Chocolate Frog Card doesn't appear in any of Harry Potter video games. Rowan Khanna mentions obtaining his card in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, however.[3] Etymology The name "Ptolemy" comes from the Greek name Πτολεμαιος (Ptolemaios), derived from Greek πολεμηιος (polemeios) meaning "aggressive" or "warlike".
