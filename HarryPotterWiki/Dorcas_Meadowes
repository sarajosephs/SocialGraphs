She fought in the First Wizarding War and before the war ended was murdered by Lord Voldemort personally.[2]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography During the First Wizarding War, Dorcas became a member of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation led and founded by Albus Dumbledore, in order to oppose Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.[2] Dorcas was murdered by Lord Voldemort sometime in the second half of 1981, along with many members of the Order. In 1995, Mad-Eye Moody showed Harry Potter a group photo of the first Order of the Phoenix that included Dorcas.[2]  Magical abilities and skills Magical mastery: She was considered a big enough threat to the Death Eaters, that Voldemort himself murdered her. It is highly likely that Dorcas was a very powerful and talented witch, who was proficient in many different branches of magic.[2] Etymology The name "Dorcas" is derived from Greek δορκας (dorkas) meaning "gazelle". In the Bible, Dorcas (Latin: Tabitha) was an important disciple in Joppa, where she gave liberally of her time, money and skills. She was so loved that when she died, the other disciples in Joppa called Peter, who came and prayed over her and raised her from the dead.[4] Meadowes is an English topographical surname (ie. indicating where someone lived) of medieval origin. It denotes someone who lives in or near meadows/grassland.[5]  Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 6 images related to Dorcas Meadowes.
