Despite his affinity towards dark magic, he refused to discuss Horcruxes, deeming them and the ritual involved too dark even for him. Godelot perished in his own cellar, after he was locked in by his son, Hereward, who did this to gain ownership of the Elder Wand.[3]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (First mentioned) The Tales of Beedle the Bard (First appearance) Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (Mentioned only) Harry Potter: Wizards Unite (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ It is most likely that he owned another wand before the Elder Wand.  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 21 (The Tale of the Three Brothers)  ↑ The Tales of Beedle the Bard - Albus Dumbledore on "The Tale of the Three Brothers"        Preceded by:Unknown, eventually Egbert the Egregious  Master of the Elder Wand  Succeeded by:Hereward        Known owners of the Deathly Hallows      Elder Wand   Death (manufacturer) · Antioch Peverell · Antioch Peverell's killer · Emeric the Evil · Egbert the Egregious · Godelot · Hereward · Barnabas Deverill · Loxias · Arcus or Livius · Mykew Gregorovitch · Gellert Grindelwald · Albus Dumbledore · Draco Malfoy (master only) · Tom Riddle (owner only) · Harry Potter · (Interred)   Resurrection Stone   Death (manufacturer) · Cadmus Peverell · (generations of Gaunts) · Corvinus Gaunt · Marvolo Gaunt · Morfin Gaunt · Tom Riddle · Albus Dumbledore · Harry Potter · (Lost)   Cloak of Invisibility   Death (manufacturer) · Ignotus Peverell · Ignotus Peverell's son · Iolanthe Potter · (generations of Potters) · Henry Potter · Fleamont Potter · James Potter I · Albus Dumbledore (owner only) · Harry Potter · James Potter II · Albus Potter             Categories         Categories:   Authors    Dark wizards    Elder Wand masters    Historical figures    Males    Murder victims             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Português do Brasil Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
