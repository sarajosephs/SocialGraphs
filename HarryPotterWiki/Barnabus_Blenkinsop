February, 1999)[1] was a wizard. His death was announced in the Daily Prophet. His obituary offered a reward for information about what happened to him, since all that was found in his bed in St Mungo's was a can of anchovies.[2]  Behind the scenes While the fate that befell Blenkinsop is ultimately unknown, the Ministry of Magic eventually solved the mystery of his disappearance, as prior to the London Five incident in 2015, no one in Great Britain had disappeared without a trace since the 'Dark Times'.[3] Appearances Daily Prophet Newsletters (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 His obituary is featured on a Daily Prophet dated 8 February, however it is most likely he died the day before.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 Daily Prophet Newsletters  ↑ Harry Potter: Wizards Unite     St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries   Founder Mungo Bonham   Alchemy Room · 'Dangerous' Dai Llewellyn Ward: Serious Bites · Entrance dummy · Hospital Ward · Janus Thickey Ward · Poisoning Department · Purge and Dowse, Ltd · St Mungo's Admissions Department · St Mungo's Certified Healer Insignia · St Mungo's student programme   Employees   Positions  Healer · Mediwizard · Trainee Healer · Welcome Witch     Healers  Omar Abasi · Eustace Burke · Dilys Derwent · Lancelot · Rutherford Poke · Augustus Pye · Hippocrates Smethwyck · Helbert Spleen · Miriam Strout · Wiggins · Talbott Winger's mother   Patients   Katie Bell · Bilton Bilmes · Bitten St Mungo's patient · Barnabus Blenkinsop · Philbert Chivers · Herbert Chorley · John Dawlish · Fugitive werewolf · Grubby-looking St Mungo's patient · Rubeus Hagrid · Penny Haywood · Gordon Horton · Jacob · Minerva McGonagall · Eloise Mintumble · Montgomery · Esme Page · Miriam Strout · Laura Thorn · Nymphadora Tonks · Unidentified dragonologist · Unidentified St Mungo's patient · Unidentified werewolf · Arthur Weasley · Winged St Mungo's patient · Winifred Warrington   Long-term residents  Agnes · Alice Longbottom · Broderick Bode (deceased) · Frank Longbottom · Gilderoy Lockhart · Zenith Xeep             Categories         Categories:   1999 deaths    British individuals    Males    St Mungo's patients    Wizards             Languages      Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
