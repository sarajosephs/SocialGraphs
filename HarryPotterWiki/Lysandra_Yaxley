The couple had three children together: Callidora, Cedrella, and Charis Black. Through Cedrella, who was disowned for marrying "blood traitor" Septimus Weasley, she is the maternal grandmother of Arthur Weasley. Lysandra may be related to the Death Eater Corban Yaxley, and, through her daughters, the Longbottom and Crouch families.[2]  Etymology Lysandra is the feminine form of the Greek name Lysander, meaning "a release of man" or "liberty".[4] It was the name of Spartan general and a character in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.
