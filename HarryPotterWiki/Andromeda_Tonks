No, Andromeda's not on here either, look. Andromeda's sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so —" — Sirius Black on Andromeda's refusal to live up to her families' expectations[src]  Andromeda "Dromeda" Tonks (née Black) (b. between 1951 and 1955),[1] was an English pure-blood witch and the middle daughter of Cygnus and Druella Black (née Rosier), as well as the sister of Bellatrix and Narcissa. She attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1960s and was sorted into Slytherin House. After graduating from Hogwarts, she married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, and was disowned by her prejudiced pure-blood supremacist family. From that point onward she and her relatives had no further contact. In 1973 she became the mother of Nymphadora Tonks. Her daughter later became an Auror in 1994 under the watchful eyes of Alastor Moody. During the Second Wizarding War, Andromeda and her husband were allies of the Order of the Phoenix, as their daughter was a member. Nymphadora married Remus Lupin in 1997 and had a son, Edward Remus Lupin. In 1998 during the height of the war Andromeda's husband was murdered by Snatchers. Remus was murdered during the Battle of Hogwarts and Nymphadora was also murdered by Andromeda's older sister, Bellatrix Lestrange. After the Second Wizarding War, Andromeda raised her grandson with the help of his godfather Harry Potter. This meant that Teddy also spent time with the Potter and Weasley families.

She was the second daughter of Cygnus and Druella Black (née Rosier), and younger sister of Bellatrix Lestrange and older sister of Narcissa Malfoy. Walburga and Orion Black were her aunt and uncle on her father's side, and Sirius and Regulus Black her cousins. Evan Rosier may be a relative on her mother's side. Alphard Black was also Andromeda's uncle.[4] She was Sirius Black's favourite cousin, but he never met her married family before his imprisonment in Azkaban in 1981.[5]  Hogwarts years  "She is no niece of ours, my Lord. We — Narcissa and I — have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries." — The recent marriage of Nymphadora Tonks[src]  Andromeda attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s and was sorted into Slytherin House.[3] She may have been very skilled in Charms class, given her proficiency with casting various household charms. It is also possible that she was talented in Defence Against the Dark Arts. In her adult life she managed to resist torture without revealing any vital information or losing her sanity. At some point during or after her education at Hogwarts, Andromeda met and subsequently fell in love with Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks, despite her family's steadfast belief in the importance of blood purity.  Life after Hogwarts  "My mum's got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly —she even gets the socks to fold themselves — but I've never mastered how she does it — it's a kind of flick —" — Nymphadora speaking about Andromeda's cleanliness and neatness[src]     Andromeda with her husband Ted Tonks   Andromeda married Ted and was subsequently disowned and burned off the family tapestry in 12 Grimmauld Place by her aunt, parents and sisters. Statements by her sisters indicate that both of them cut off contact with Andromeda because they considered her a blood traitor for her marriage.[6] In 1973, around the age of twenty, Andromeda and Ted had one child, Nymphadora Tonks. Andromeda had selected the first name, which her daughter strongly disliked, preferring to be known simply as "Tonks" by her friends. Ted, Remus Lupin, and Andromeda called her Dora for short. Andromeda, throughout her family life with Ted and Nymphadora, had a constant talent for cleanliness that her husband and daughter did not share.[5]      Andromeda's burn mark on the Black Family Tapestry   Her daughter, Nymphadora, began her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1984 and was sorted into Hufflepuff House at the Sorting ceremony. Nymphadora graduated from Hogwarts in 1991 and went on to train and later work as an Auror for the British Ministry of Magic. Nymphadora worked as an Auror between the wars and during the Second Wizarding War. Andromeda frequently worried about her daughter's safety.  Second Wizarding War (1995-1998)  Andromeda: "What happened to our daughter? Hagrid said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?" Harry Potter: "I don't know. We don't know what happened to anyone else." — Andromeda concerned for her daughter's safety[src]  Although Andromeda and Ted did not appear to be official members of the Order of the Phoenix, they allowed their home to be one of the Order's safe-houses and were supportive of the organisation to which their daughter belonged. Nymphadora married Remus Lupin in the summer of 1997; he suspected that her parents did not approve because he was a werewolf, though it is unknown if this was true; given the fact that Andromeda was not a pure-blood supremacist. After the Battle of the Seven Potters, they were instrumental in Harry Potter's moving from Privet Drive to The Burrow: Harry Potter and Rubeus Hagrid took temporary refuge in Tonks' home, where Andromeda took care of Hagrid's injuries. She seemed somewhat offended when Harry first reacted to her as if she were her sister Bellatrix because of their resemblance. She and Ted were both very worried about their daughter when they learned that the Order was ambushed by Death Eaters when transporting Harry, though Ted tried to reassure his wife by pointing out that their daughter had been through worse in the course of her work as an Auror. When the Ministry of Magic fell under Lord Voldemort's control in August of 1997, the magical protections around the Order safe-houses were broken. Andromeda and Ted were interrogated and tortured by Death Eaters for information pertaining to Harry Potter and the Order. Their son-in-law reported that they were "shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay".[6] Soon after this, their daughter discovered that she was pregnant and came to stay with Andromeda and Ted, as her husband temporarily left her out of fear that he would pass on lycanthropy to their child. The Ministry soon began persecuting Muggle-borns by forming the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, which charged Muggle-borns with having stolen their magic and their wands from "real" witches and wizards. Ted refused to register on principle and was forced to go on the run; Andromeda, as a pure-blood, was safe and stayed with her pregnant daughter. Some time before the birth of her grandson Teddy, Andromeda was left a widow, as her husband was murdered by Snatchers. Andromeda's daughter and son-in-law were killed in action during the Battle of Hogwarts by Bellatrix Lestrange, Andromeda's sister, and Antonin Dolohov, respectively. Bellatrix was later killed herself by Molly Weasley.  Later life (Post 1998) Andromeda was left with custody of her grandson, though Teddy also spent a lot of time with his godfather, Harry Potter, and the Weasley family.[6]  Physical appearance  "As she moved forward into the room, Mrs Tonks's resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder." — Andromeda's physical similarity to her sister Bellatrix Lestrange[src]  Andromeda was described to have an uncanny physical resemblance to her older sister, Bellatrix, to the extent where Harry almost attacked her during their first meeting.  Hence, she most likely had the patrician beauty and aristocratic bearing that were the typical characteristics of the House of Black, the only differences being that, while Bellatrix was dark-haired and had heavily-lidded, malicious-looking eyes, Andromeda had light brown hair, and her eyes were wider and kinder.[2]  Personality and traits It is safe to assume, given her marriage to a Muggle-born, that Andromeda was very different from both of her sisters: while her sisters married into "respectable" pure-blood families, she married for love despite her family's opposition, leading to her family's hatred of her. She was clearly a good mother, as seen by her showing her concern about her daughter's whereabouts after the Battle of the Seven Potters and taking care of her during her pregnancy. She was also a good grandmother, as she raised her daughter's son after her death. Apart from her husband and daughter, her cousin Sirius Black considered her to be his only true family. This demonstrated that Andromeda always treated Sirius with respect and kindness. In addition to being a good wife, mother, and grandmother, she was a good friend to most people she knew. She was also strong-willed, as when she was tortured she did not reveal anything that could harm Harry Potter or any of her friends.  Like Molly Weasley, Andromeda was a woman dedicated to her family and friends. Thus, in many ways, Andromeda's personality contradicted the "evil Slytherin" stereotype held by many students of the other Houses. Instead, she appeared to embody the Slytherin principle of fraternity. This was seen by her standing by her friends, family, and allies.  Magical abilities and skills Healing magic: After the Battle of the Seven Potters, Harry and Hagrid took refuge in her house, where she successfully healed Hagrid's injuries. Given Hagrid's half-giant nature and concomitant natural magical resistance, this does imply she was a talented Healer.[6] Household magic: Andromeda had a talent for cleanliness and household spells, a talent that her husband and her daughter did not share. According to Nymphadora Tonks, Andromeda was skilled with Pack Charm, getting stuff to fit itself in neatly and even getting socks to fold themselves.[7] Relationships Family Black Family     Narcissa Malfoy, her younger sister   Andromeda's relationship with her parents was likely a bad one. Because she married a Muggle-born against her family's ideals of blood purity she was disowned and not considered a Black after that. It is safe to assume that her parents did not consider her as their daughter anymore and, like Bellatrix and Narcissa, cut off all contact with her. It is also possible that Andromeda's parents never met their granddaughter. It is unknown what kind of relationship Andromeda had with her older sister, Bellatrix Lestrange, and younger sister, Narcissa Malfoy, when they were younger. However, both her sisters believed in pure-blood supremacy, whereas Andromeda obviously did not, given her marriage.      Bellatrix Lestrange, her older sister and murderer of her daughter   After she married the Muggle-born Ted, Andromeda was disowned and both her sisters cut off all contact with her.[6] Andromeda's relationship with Bellatrix was likely particularly hateful, given that Bellatrix murdered Andromeda's own daughter (though, given the circumstances, she likely didn't learn of the latter until after the battle and her eldest sister's death). It can be assumed that Bellatrix would not have hesitated to kill Andromeda herself if she ever encountered her again. Andromeda also seemed to be offended when Harry Potter, upon first seeing her, reacted as if she were her older sister.[6] It can also be presumed that Andromeda showed no remorse for her older sister's death at the hands of Molly Weasley. This lack of remorse can be attributed to Bellatrix's cruelty towards her and her murder of her child and Sirius. Andromeda's relationship with Narcissa, however, is unknown, though it was most likely similar to that of her relationship to Bellatrix and thus extremely hateful. It is doubtful the two ever met again even following Voldemort's defeat as Narcissa still strongly valued pure-blood supremacy. Andromeda's younger cousin Sirius Black told Harry Potter in 1995 that Andromeda was his favourite cousin.[5] Like her, Sirius was considered a "blood traitor" by their family, and was disowned for his beliefs. Thus, the two were likely close in their younger years. Sirius considered Andromeda and Tonks his only and true family.  Ted Tonks Andromeda married Ted Tonks for love in spite of her family's hatred of Muggle-borns (and usual habit of forced marriages) which led to her being disowned[5] and shunned by her own sisters. Ted comforted his wife when they were unsure what happened to their daughter after the Battle of the Seven Potters, reassuring her that, as an Auror, Tonks had been through worse.[6]  Nymphadora Tonks  Remus Lupin: "Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname only." Nymphadora Tonks: "So would you if your fool of a mother had called you Nymphadora." — Nymphadora's dislike of her own name[src]      Nymphadora Lupin, her late daughter   Nymphadora and her mother were close, though Tonks disliked the given name Andromeda gave her,[5] to the point of Nymphadora describing her mother as foolish for giving her the name. It's unknown how Andromeda took the news that her daughter and Remus Lupin were in love and that they planned to marry. It's also unknown how she initially reacted to Nymphadora's pregnancy. Andromeda was frantic with worry over her daughter's participation in the Second Wizarding War and opted to stay with her during her pregnancy, while Ted went on the run from the Muggle-Born Registration Commission.  When Tonks went to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, she left her infant son in the care of his grandmother. It's unknown how she took the news of her daughter's death at the hands of her older sister, Bellatrix. One can assume that the loss of her only child was devastating. After the final battle of the Second Wizarding War, Andromeda would raise the boy after his parents' deaths with the help of Teddy´s godfather Harry Potter.[6]  Harry Potter  "Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid. You! he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty." — Harry meets Andromeda for the first time[src]      Harry Potter, godfather of her grandson   The first time Harry met Andromeda, he thought that she looked a lot like her sister Bellatrix but with kinder eyes and lighter hair.[2] Her resemblance to Bellatrix was such that Harry attempted to attack her, but upon realising his mistake, he felt bad and apologised as her physical comparison to her sister seemed offensive to her. After Voldemort's downfall, Harry helped Andromeda raise her grandson and his godson, Teddy Lupin. Harry liked and respected Andromeda for her ideals and because she was Tonks' mother. It is possible that after the war they would see each other regularly and probable in such a scenario that they would develop a bond because of Teddy, Remus, and Tonks's memory. It is also highly likely that Andromeda herself was welcomed at Harry and Ginny's house as a dinner guest, along with her grandson.  Order of the Phoenix Andromeda was not an official member of the Order of the Phoenix, but nevertheless, she supported the Order's ideals (given her marriage to a Muggle-born). As her daughter and son-in-law were members, she would allow the Order use of her house as a safe house. It is likely that she has a good relation with all of the members, and because she was at Hogwarts at the same time as Arthur and Molly Weasley, a friendship might have started there.  The degree and nature of her involvement during the First Wizarding War is unknown, but it is reasonable to assume that she helped them in some way. Andromeda proved her loyalty in 1998 when she was tortured by Death Eater in her home and did not reveal anything of importance regarding Harry or the Order, despite the fact that she was under torture.  Etymology Many members of the House of Black — such as Sirius, Bellatrix, and Cygnus — appear to be named after stars or constellations, and the name Andromeda follows this pattern. It is a northern constellation that contains the Andromeda Galaxy and was named after the character from Greek mythology: a princess who was chained to a rock to be sacrificed to a sea monster, as divine punishment for her mother's (Cassiopeia) boasting, but was saved by the hero Perseus, whom she then married. This may allude to Andromeda Tonks' estrangement from her aristocratic, but cruel extended family.  Behind the scenes Out of the three Black sisters, Andromeda was the only sister that has not appeared in any of the films. Andromeda is also the only one of the five Black cousins who has not appeared in the films, as her two sisters appeared in the Half-Blood Prince through to the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Bellatrix also appearing in the Order of the Phoenix. Sirius Black appeared in Prisoner of Azkaban through Order of the Phoenix and in Deathly Hallows: Part 2, and a younger Regulus Black appeared in one of Horace Slughorn's photographs in the Half-Blood Prince. Due to the similarities in appearance shared by Andromeda and her sister, Bellatrix Lestrange, fans of the Harry Potter series set up an online petition to have Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Bellatrix, play Andromeda in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.[8] However, as Harry and Hagrid escape to the Burrow rather than the Tonks house, Andromeda and Ted were both cut from the film. There seems to be a common recurrence in the Black Family tree where the middle of three children get disowned, Cedrella Black for marrying blood-traitor Septimus Weasley, Alphard Black for giving his disowned nephew "a decent bit of gold" and Andromeda herself for marrying a Muggle-born. Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First mentioned) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Appears on tapestry) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game) (Seen on Black family tree tapestry) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (First appearance) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game) (Seen on Black family tree tapestry) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (Mentioned only) Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (Indirectly mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 The Black family tapestry shows that Andromeda is younger than Bellatrix, who was born in 1951, and older than Narcissa, who was born in 1955.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 5 (Fallen Warrior) - "Her hair was a light, soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder."  ↑ 3.0 3.1 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 4 (Horace Slughorn) - Horace Slughorn states: "The whole Black family had been in my house, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor!" This implies that all Blacks except Sirius were Sorted into Slytherin while Slughorn was Head of House. Andromeda presumably attended Hogwarts from the mid-1960s to early 1970s, and thus would have been a student of Slughorn, who was stated to have begun teaching at Hogwarts around the same time as Albus Dumbledore in Chapter 5 of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, in 1938 or earlier. Sirius Black also states "My whole family have been in Slytherin" and in Chapter 23 of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, confirming that at least those Blacks closely related to Sirius were in Slytherin.  ↑ Black family tree  ↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  ↑ 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 6.6 6.7 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  ↑ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 3 (The Advance Guard)  ↑ http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/HelenaBCforAndromedaTonks/     Order of the Phoenix      Founder:Albus Dumbledore   Leaders:Albus Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Kingsley Shacklebolt   Original Order of of the Phoenix:Aberforth Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Alice Longbottom | Arabella Figg | Benjy Fenwick | Caradoc Dearborn | Dedalus Diggle | Dorcas Meadowes | Edgar Bones | Elphias Doge | Emmeline Vance | Fabian Prewett | Frank Longbottom | Gideon Prewett | James Potter | Lily Potter | Marlene McKinnon | Mundungus Fletcher | Peter Pettigrew (defected) | Remus Lupin | Rubeus Hagrid | Severus Snape | Sirius Black | Sturgis Podmore   Reconstituted Order of the Phoenix: Aberforth Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Arabella Figg | Arthur Weasley | Bill Weasley | Charlie Weasley | Dedalus Diggle | Elphias Doge | Emmeline Vance | Fleur Delacour | Fred Weasley | George Weasley | Harry Potter | Hermione Granger | Hestia Jones | Kingsley Shacklebolt | Minerva McGonagall | Molly Weasley | Mundungus Fletcher | Nymphadora Tonks | Remus Lupin | Ron Weasley | Rubeus Hagrid | Severus Snape | Sirius Black | Sturgis Podmore   Order of the Phoenix allies:Andromeda Tonks | Augusta Longbottom | Buckbeak | Dobby | Fawkes | Filius Flitwick | Firenze | Garrick Ollivander | Ginny Weasley | Grawp | Helena Ravenclaw | Horace Slughorn | Karkus | Karkus's wife | Kreacher | Lee Jordan | Luna Lovegood | McKinnon family | Mr Westenberg | Mrs Westenberg | Muriel | Nearly-Headless Nick | Neville Longbottom | Oliver Wood | Olympe Maxime | Rita Skeeter | Peeves | Percy Weasley | Pomona Sprout | Poppy Pomfrey | Sybill Trelawney | Ted Tonks | The Fallen Fifty | Westenberg family | Winky | Xenophilius Lovegood   Other affiliations:Dumbledore's Army | Forbidden Forest Centaur colony | Headless Hunt | Hogwarts Hippogriff herd | Hogwarts house-elves | Hogwarts Ghosts | Hogwarts Staff | Hogwarts students | Hogwarts Thestral herd | Ministry of Magic | Giant colony (Karkus's control)             Categories         Categories:   1950s births    Blood traitors    Bulstrode family descendants    Crabbe family descendants    Cruciatus Curse victims    Disowned members of the House of Black    English individuals    Females    Flint family descendants    Individuals with shortened names    Order of the Phoenix allies    Parents    Pure-bloods    Rosier family descendants    Slytherins    Sorted in the 1960s    Tonks family    Widowed individuals    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Deutsch Español Suomi Français Italiano 日本語 Nederlands Norsk Polski Русский Svenska 中文      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
