Perseus Parkinson   Biographical information  Born Pre 1709   Blood status Pure-blood[1]   Title(s) Minister for Magic[2]    Physical information  Species Human[2]   Gender Male[2]    Relationship information  Family members Pansy Parkinson (possible)Parkinson family    Affiliation  Occupation British Minister for Magic (1726 - 1733)[2]   Loyalty Parkinson family[2]British Ministry of Magic[2]   [Source]    "Rowle was succeeded by Perseus Parkinson, who was likewise pro-Azkaban." — Perseus' views as Minister for Magic[src] Minister Perseus Parkinson was British Minister for Magic from 1726 to 1733.[2] Biography He attempted to pass a bill making it illegal to marry a Muggle. However, in doing so, he misread the public mood; the wizarding public was tired of anti-Muggle sentiment and wanted peace. Parkinson was therefore voted out during the next election for Minister.[2] Perseus Parkinson's attempts to ban mixed marriages were identical to Rappaport's Law introduced by MACUSA president Emily Rappaport. However, unlike in the United States of America, anti-Muggle sentiments were not as widespread and confined to wizarding supremacists. Perseus Parkinson was related in some way to Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin student in the same year as Harry Potter and a close friend of Draco Malfoy. It is even likely that Pansy was a direct descendant of Perseus.
