How long did you get in detention for saying that to Prendergast?" Newt Scamander: "You know, I think it was a month that time." Leta Lestrange: "And I set off a Dungbomb under his desk so I could join you, do you remember?" — Newton Scamander and Leta Lestrange at the Ministry of Magic, 1927[src]  Professor Prendergast was a wizard who worked at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in around the 1910s as a subject professor, as well as Head of House.[3]  Biograhy He once gave Newton Scamander a month's worth of detention for arguing that there are no such thing as strange creatures, just blinkered people. Leta Lestrange later set off a dungbomb under Prendergast's desk so she could join Newt in detention.[4]  Appearances Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay (First mentioned) Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (Mentioned only) Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore: Movie Magic (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ He reprimanded Newt, who began at Hogwarts in 1908. As he was in a position to do so, he must have been born, at the latest, in 1890, as Hogwarts teachers can begin teaching at age 18, after graduating.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore: Movie Magic  ↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay, Scene 18     Hogwarts faculty   Founders  Godric Gryffindor | Helga Hufflepuff | Rowena Ravenclaw | Salazar Slytherin   Headteachers  Giffard Abbott | Walter Aragon | Bearded man holding a book | Phineas Nigellus Black | Elizabeth Burke | Antonia Creaseworthy | Dilys Derwent | Armando Dippet | Albus Dumbledore | Mordicus Egg | Everard | First headmaster | Dexter Fortescue | Basil Fronsac | Brian Gagwilde | Limebert | Minerva McGonagall | Eupraxia Mole | Pink-faced headmaster | Resting headmaster | Edessa Sakndenberg | Brutus Scrimgeour | Phyllida Spore | Severus Snape | Amrose Swott | Quentin Trimble | Dolores Umbridge | Fytherley Undercliffe | Vindictus Viridian | Vulpus | Heliotrope Wilkins | Gimlet-eyed headmistress | Headmaster (1568) | Headteacher (1792) | Headmaster in blue | Headmaster with book | Headmaster in gold | Headmaster with apple | Headmaster with astrolabe | Headmaster with castle sketch | Headmaster with paper | Headmaster with rings | Headmaster with scroll | Headmaster with sphere | Headmaster with starmap | Headmaster with wand   Deputy Heads  Minerva McGonagall | Amycus Carrow | Alecto Carrow   Heads of House  Muldoon Cragg | Filius Flitwick | Godric Gryffindor | Gryffindor lady | Gryffindor man (II) | Gryffindor man (III) | Gryffindor man (IV) | Gryffindor Seeker | Helga Hufflepuff | Neville Longbottom | Minerva McGonagall  | Valeria Myriadd | Uric Oapley | Podric Piles | Prendergast | Rowena Ravenclaw | Horace Slughorn | Salazar Slytherin | Severus Snape | Pomona Sprout | Tobias Stump   Teaching staff  Bartholomew | Bathsheda Babbling | Herbert Beery | Cuthbert Binns | Brindlemore | Charity Burbage | Camelia | Alecto Carrow | Amycus Carrow | Bartemius Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody) | Clodagh Dromgoole | Albus Dumbledore | Eleazar Fig | Firenze | Filius Flitwick | Fortinbras | Jakub Gorski | Olivia Green | Rubeus Hagrid | Hecat | Rolanda Hooch | Ernesto Jags | Arsenius Jigger | Igor Karkaroff's Yule Ball partner | Silvanus Kettleburn | Gilderoy Lockhart | Neville Longbottom | Remus Lupin | Elspeth MacGillony | Mazoni | Minerva McGonagall | Galatea Merrythought | Natsai Onai's mother | Prendergast | Quirinus Quirrell | Patricia Rakepick | Abraham Ronen | Concordia Rowle | Arif Sikander | Aurora Sinistra | Horace Slughorn | Severus Snape | Pomona Sprout | Swoopstikes | Sybill Trelawney | Trocar | Dolores Umbridge | Septima Vector | Unidentified professor | Potions professor (16th century) | Flying Instructor (19th century) | Herbology professor (19th century) | Potions professor (19th century) | DADA professor (1984–1985) | DADA professor (1985–1986) | DADA professor (1986–1987) | DADA professor (1987–1988) | DADA professor (1989–1990) | DADA professor (1990–1991) | Muggle Studies professor (1990s) | DADA professor (1998–?) | Potions professor (21st century) | Charms professor (?th century)   Hogwarts house-elves  Bilm | Boil-ridden house-elf | Deek | Dobby | Filk | Gimkey | Krafty | Kreacher | Pitts | Retch | Vekey | Wigby | Winky | Unidentified house-elf   Support staff  Rancorous Carpe | Argus Filch | Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank | Rubeus Hagrid | Rolanda Hooch | Hankerton Humble | Ogg | Irma Pince | Poppy Pomfrey | Apollyon Pringle | Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus | Wainscott | Unidentified Healers | Unidentified female nurse | Unidentified librarian | Unidentified male nurse             Categories         Categories:   British or Irish individuals    Heads of House    Males    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
