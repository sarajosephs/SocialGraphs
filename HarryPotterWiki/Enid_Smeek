Ran wild. 'Course, with his mum and dad gone you'd have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don't think Albus was fussed about him. I never saw them together, anyway." — Enid Smeek, to Rita Skeeter on her sensationalist book The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.[src]  Enid Smeek (fl.1890—1997) was a witch who lived in the outskirts of Godric's Hollow in the late nineteenth century, at the same time as the Dumbledore family.[1] She presented Rita Skeeter her testimony about the Dumbledores for the sensationalist tell-all biography of Albus Dumbledore that Skeeter wrote in 1997, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, in which she said Albus's brother Aberforth used to throw goat dung at her, and that Bathilda Bagshot, the famed historian, was "nutty as squirrel poo".[1]  Etymology The name "Enid" is derived from Welsh enaid meaning "soul" or "life". Enid was the wife of Geraint in Arthurian legend.
