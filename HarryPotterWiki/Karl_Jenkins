As the Sorting Ceremony was starting, he expressed wonder at the prospect of Albus Potter, son of the famous Harry Potter, being in his year.[4] Karl was sorted into Hufflepuff House.[3] When Albus Potter proved unable to get his broomstick to rise off the ground during their first Flying lesson with Madam Hooch, Karl teased him, calling him the "Slytherin Squib".[4]  Second year During a second-year Potions lesson, Albus and Scorpius Malfoy had difficulty preparing their potion, prompting Karl to tell the other students in the class to "leave [Albus] and Voldemort's child to it".[4]  Fourth year Upon returning to 2020 after altering the past, Scorpius Malfoy found himself in an alternate reality in which Lord Voldemort won, and was greeted as the "Scorpion King" by Karl Jenkins on the Hogwarts grounds. Yann Fredericks asked Scorpius if he was still on for an event the following night and Karl enthused they were both ready to "spill some proper Mudblood guts".[5]  Behind the scenes In the original West End Palace Theatre production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Karl is played by Jack North. In the second West End cast (2017-2018) of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Karl is played by Tom Mackley. In the fourth (2019-2020) and fifth West End cast (2021-2022), Karl is predominantly played by understudy, Gordon Millar.
