He was Sorted into Ravenclaw house and was incredibly nervous, often twitching and trembling during his Sorting.[2]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes  2.1 Translations   3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology "Stewart" is from an occupational surname originally belonging to a person who was a steward. It is ultimately derived from Old English stig "house" and weard "guard". As a given name, it arose in 19th century Scotland in honour of the Stuart royal family, which produced several kings and queens of Scotland and Britain between the 14th and 18th centuries.[3] "Ackerley" is a Middle English name meaning 'aker', a division of land + 'ley', a lea or field.[4] Behind the scenes Translations Bulgarian: Стюарт Акърли Chinese (Simplified): 斯图尔特·阿克利 Chinese (Traditional): 史都華·艾克利 Dutch: Sextus Aardveil German: Stewart Ackerley (in the first edition, it was Sterwart Ackerly) Hebrew: סטיוארט אקרלי Japanese: スチュワート・アッカリー Lithuanian: Stiuartas Akerlis Norwegian: Stig Abelsen Russian: Стюарт Акерли (Styuart Akerli) Serbian: Стјуарт Акерли (Stjuart Akerli) The following languages are the same as the original:     Afrikaans Croatian   Danish Faroese   Finnish French   Polish Portuguese   Spanish Swedish  Appearances Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 12 (The Triwizard Tournament)  ↑ http://www.behindthename.com/name/stuart  ↑ http://www.searchforancestors.com/surnames/origin/a/ackerley.php              Categories         Categories:   1980s births    British or Irish individuals    Males    Ravenclaws    Sorted in 1994    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Suomi Français Polski Русский Svenska 中文      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
