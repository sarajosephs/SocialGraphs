Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology    Irma’s husband Pollux and son Cygnus on the Black family tree tapestry   Irma is a German short form of names beginning with the Old Germanic element ermen, meaning "whole" or "universal".[3]  Behind the scenes Irma was possibly a member of Slytherin house as a Hogwarts student, like the rest of her family. It is possible that Irma had a niece: Araminta Meliflua. This is presumed as Walburga Black (Irma’s daughter) was first cousin of Araminta. Pollux Black (Irma’s husband) had three siblings, only one is known to have married and had a son.
