Basil: "Hello there, Arthur. Not on duty, eh? It's all right for some… We've been here all night… You'd better get out of the way, we've got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five fifteen. Hang on, I'll find your campsite… Weasley… Weasley… About a quarter of a mile's walk over there, first field you come to. Site manager's called Mr Roberts. Diggory… second field… ask for Mr Payne." Arthur Weasley: "Thanks, Basil." — Harry Potter, the Weasleys and the Diggories arrive at the Portkey terminus of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup[src]  Basil was a wizard and Ministry of Magic employee. In the 1990s, Basil worked for the Department of Magical Transportation, most likely in the Portkey Office.[3] At the Quidditch World Cup final in 1994, he was one of the wizards staffing the Portkey terminus, and had been there for most of the morning with a large party that was arriving from the Black Forest in Germany. He was wearing a poncho and a kilt in an attempt to look like a Muggle.[4]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance) Pottermore Notes and references   ↑ Basil and his colleagues are "dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly," which indicates that he was not raised among Muggles, as most Muggle-borns would have at least some experience with putting together a Muggle outfit.  ↑ 2.0 2.1  Pottermore  ↑ It seems a safe assumption this individual worked for the Department of Magical Transportation, as he worked with Portkeys.  ↑ Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 7 (Bagman and Crouch)     Department of Magical Transportation employees   Heads of Department   Head of the Department of Magical Transportation  ·  Percy Weasley   Other personnel   Basil  ·  Madam Edgecombe  ·  Wilkie Twycross  ·  Floo Regulation Panel employee             Categories         Categories:   1994 Quidditch World Cup attendees    British individuals    Department of Magical Transportation personnel    Males    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
