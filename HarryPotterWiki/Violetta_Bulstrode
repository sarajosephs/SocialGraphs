Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology Violetta is a version of the name Violet, derived from the flower. The name is well-known for being the stage name of a German-born circus performer born without legs or arms who was famous during the 1920s. The name Violetta could also be meant to mean, or be a reference to, the words violent or violence. Bulstrode is an English surname that can refer to the medieval village of Bulstrode in Berkshire. It means either "the bull's marsh", or "the fort on the marsh". Therefore, Violetta's name could mean 'violent attitude or temper'.  Behind the scenes Violetta is the great-grandmother of Narcissa Malfoy, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius Black, Andromeda Tonks, and Regulus Black, the great-great-grandmother of Nymphadora Lupin and Draco Malfoy, and the great-great-great-grandmother of Teddy Lupin and Scorpius Malfoy. Before the reveal that Fleamont and Euphemia Potter were the parents of James, it was speculated that Violetta's daughter Dorea and her husband Charlus were his parents and thus the grandparents of Harry Potter. Therefore, Violetta was the presumed grandmother and great-grandmother of James and Harry, respectively.
