The British Ministry of Magic warned him repeatedly about this infraction, but he did not listen, and was eventually sent to Azkaban for this.[1][2][3][4]  Etymology The name "Crispin" is from the Roman cognomen Crispinus which was derived from the name Crispus. Saint Crispin was a 3rd-century Roman who was martyred with his twin brother Crispinian in Gaul. They are the patrons of shoemakers. They were popular saints in England during the Middle Ages, and the name has occasionally been used since that time. A "Cronk" is an Australian slang word for "fraudulent," particularly in talking about running racehorses. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 3 images related to Crispin Cronk.
