In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it." — Remus Lupin regarding the violent nature of this tree[src]  Davey Gudgeon was a wizard and student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1970s.[2]  Biography Gudgeon nearly lost his eye trying to get close enough to the Whomping Willow to touch its trunk as part of a game. Ever since the incident, students were forbidden to go near the tree for their own safety, and possibly for the tree's own safety as well.[2]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Chapter 10 (The Marauder's Map)              Categories         Categories:   20th century births    British or Irish individuals    Gudgeon family    Hogwarts students during the Marauders' era    Males    Unknown House    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Français Polski      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
