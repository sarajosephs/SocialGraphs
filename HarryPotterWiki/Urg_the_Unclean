Urg the Unclean   Biographical information  Born c. 18th century[1]    Physical information  Species Goblin[2][1]   Gender Male[1]   Hair colour White[1]   Skin colour Tan[1]    Affiliation  Occupation Goblin rebel leader[1]   Loyalty Goblins[2]   [Source]    "Rebel leader in the 18th century goblin rebellion." — Chocolate Frog Card[src]  Urg the Unclean (fl. 18th century) was a goblin rebel who became notorious for having led the 18th century Goblin Rebellions.[1]  Biography At some point in his life he was publicly dunked in a village pond by a group of young wizards.[3] This event precipitated one of the bloody rebellions in which Urg himself was the dissident leader.[4] For his role in the Goblin Rebellions, he was featured on one Chocolate Frog Card.[1] When Ron Weasley sat his fourth-year History of Magic final, he forgot some of the names of the goblin rebels, and thus invented a few as cover, stating that this was easy because "they're all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean".[2]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (First appearance) (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First mentioned) J.

K. Rowling's official site.  ↑ This piece of information comes from the third W.O.M.B.A.T. featured in J. K. Rowling's official site. Question 2 (Part One - Magical History) is "Which of the following did NOT provoke one of the bloody goblin rebellions of the 17th and 18th centuries? Choose ONE.", and one of the possible answers is "The public ducking in the village pond, by a gang of young wizards, of goblin activist Urg the Unclean". As one of the other answers is known for certain to be false ("The imprisonment of the notoriously violent Hodrod the Horny-Handed, who had attempted to kill three wizards " — the Daily Prophet Newsletters reveal that Hodrod the Horny-Handed was indeed imprisoned for attempting to kill three wizards, but this happened in 1999, during the Chipping Clodbury riot), then all of the other answers must be true, including the one about Urg the Unclean.
