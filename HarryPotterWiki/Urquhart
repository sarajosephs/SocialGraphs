This article is about the Slytherin Chaser. You may be looking for Urquhart Rackharrow.   Urquhart   Biographical information  Born 31 August 1984 or earlier (most likely)[1]   Nationality British or Irish[2]   Title(s) Captain[3]Chaser[3]    Physical information  Species Human[3]   Gender Male[3]    Relationship information  Family members Elphinstone Urquart (possibly)Urquart family (possibly)    Affiliation  House Slytherin[3]   Loyalty Urquart family (possibly)Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[3]Slytherin[3]Slytherin Quidditch team[3]   [Source]  Urquhart was a wizard and student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s, who was a member of Slytherin house.  Contents  1 Biography 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography During the 1996–1997 school year, he was the Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team. Urquhart was new to the squad and he had not held any position on the team before, so it seemed odd that he was made the Captain, playing as a Chaser. During the match against Gryffindor, Urquhart shook hands with Harry, 'crushing it'.[3]  Behind the scenes It is possible that this character is related to Elphinstone Urquart, a high-ranking official in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and later a colleague and husband of Minerva McGonagall. His name may be a misspelling, so it is likely that there is some connection between this character and the aforementioned Elphinstone.  Appearances Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (First appearance) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) Notes and references   ↑ He was most likely at least in his second year in 1996, as first years rarely joined the House Quidditch teams. Although as he was chosen as Captain, it is more likely he was older.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 14 (Felix Felicis)        Preceded by:Graham Montague  Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team1996-1997  Succeeded by:Unknown         Quidditch positions at Hogwarts      Captains   Filemina Alchin · Astrix Alixan · Orion Amari · Angelina Appleby · Oona Ballington · Concepta Battista · Hugh Biggs · Richard Carter · Angelica Cole · Stuart Craggy · Winky Crockett · Roger Davies · Cedric Diggory · Marcus Flint · Hamish Frater · Stephen Gould · David Hamblin · Natalie Holkham · Jody Jacknife · Angelina Johnson · Jo King · Neil Lament · Steve Laughalot · Graham Montague · Mark Overcliff · Erika Rath · Andrew Snowy Owl · Harry Potter · Isobel Ross · Ashley Sanders · Lucinda Talkalot · Urquhart · Emma Vanity · Charlie Weasley · Rufus Winickus · Oliver Wood · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (I) · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (II)   Keepers   Kevin Bletchley · Miles Bletchley · Brennan Doyle · Andre Egwu · Herbert Fleet · Geoffrey Hooper · Cormac McLaggen · Grant Page · Ron Weasley · Oliver Wood · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Gryffindor Keeper · Unidentified Slytherin Keeper · Unidentified Keeper (I) · Unidentified Keeper (II) · Unidentified Keeper (III)   Chasers   Orion Amari · Tamsin Applebee · Katie Bell · Bradley · Randolph Burrow · Cadwallader · Chambers · Roger Davies · Eekins · Marcus Flint · Rose Granger-Weasley · Jarrett · Angelina Johnson · Heidi Macavoy · Graham Montague · Ethan Parkin · Skye Parkin · James Potter · Malcolm Preece · Adrian Pucey · Demelza Robins · Zacharias Smith · Alicia Spinnet · Jeremy Stretton · Dean Thomas · Urquhart · Vaisey · Cassius Warrington · Ginny Weasley · Blaise Zabini · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Chaser (I) · Unidentified Chaser (II) · Unidentified fourth-year Chaser · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (I) · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (II) · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (III) · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (IV) · Erika Rath's friend (I) · Erika Rath's friend (II) · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (I)   Beaters   Bean · Lucian Bole · Ritchie Coote · Vincent Crabbe · Peregrine Derrick · Dobbin · Gregory Goyle · Duncan Inglebee · Andrew Kirke · Michael McManus · Maxine O'Flaherty · Jimmy Peakes · Erika Rath · Anthony Rickett · Jason Samuels · Jack Sloper · Fred Weasley · George Weasley · Baglan Wellnelly · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Beater · Unidentified Gryffindor beater · Unidentified Slytherin Beater (I) · Unidentified Slytherin Beater (II) · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (II)   Seekers   Regulus Black · Cho Chang · Cedric Diggory · Andre Egwu · Harper · Terence Higgs · Gilderoy Lockhart · Draco Malfoy · Harry Potter · Summerby · Charlie Weasley · Ginny Weasley · Gruffyd Wellnelly · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Gryffindor seeker · Unidentified Hufflepuff Seeker · Unidentified Ravenclaw Seeker · Unidentified Ravenclaw Seeker's substitute · Unidentified Seeker (I) · Unidentified Seeker (II)   Unknown positions   Vicky Bishopper · Robin Higgy · R.
