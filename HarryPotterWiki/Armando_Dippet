Shame on you, Phineas!" — Dippet's portrait berating Phineas Nigellus Black[src]  Professor Armando Dippet (1637–1992)[1] was a wizard and Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the predecessor of Albus Dumbledore in the post.  Dippet served as Headmaster in the 1940s into the 1960s (and possibly the very early 70s). It was during his tenure that the Chamber of Secrets was first opened by Tom Riddle since its creation by Salazar Slytherin in around A.D. 993. Unknowingly, Dippet was indirectly responsible for the end of the attacks by telling Riddle that the school would have to be closed if said attacks continued. Dippet was also responsible for the expulsion of Rubeus Hagrid after Riddle framed him with the attacks. Dippet left office between March 1965 and March 1971[8] and was succeeded by Albus Dumbledore. He was a "nearly bald and a somewhat feeble" man in his elderly years and died in late 1992.

If so, he must have been Sorted into either Gryffindor, Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, but certainly not Slytherin, in 1649.[9] If he went through his magical education at Hogwarts, he would have graduated at the age of eighteen in 1656. What he did after his graduation is unknown, although Armando Dippet seemed to have been held in high regard in his old age, since he was eventually chosen and offered the job of being Headmaster of Hogwarts, although it is unknown whether he ever took up a teaching post prior to this appointment.  As Headmaster of Hogwarts Early years    Dippet watching Myrtle's body getting taken out of Hogwarts   Professor Dippet became Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early twentieth century,[10] at over 200 years old.[2] In his position, it is possible he was responsible for the employment of Horace Slughorn,[11] Herbert Beery,[10] Silvanus Kettleburn[10] and possibly as teachers at Hogwarts. It is also known that he was responsible for hiring Minerva McGonagall, having offered her "a job in the Transfiguration department, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore".[12] He may have immediately succeeded Phineas Nigellus Black as Headmaster, after his death in 1925. If so, Dippet would have sent students home early in the following year and increased the security of Hogwarts in response to the threat from Gellert Grindelwald.[13]  Christmas pantomime  "The night's entertainment concluded with a packed hospital wing..." — Albus Dumbledore[src]  During Dippet's tenure as Headmaster, Herbert Beery, then-Herbology master, proposed an adaptation of The Fountain of Fair Fortune as a Christmas treat for both staff and students. The show, however, was a fiasco: the students playing Amata and Sir Luckless had been boyfriend and girlfriend until one hour before the show, at which point "Sir Luckless" dumped her for "Asha". During the play, the Engorged Ashwinder portraying the Worm (provided by the reckless Professor Silvanus Kettleburn) exploded in a shower of hot sparks and dust, filling the Great Hall with smoke and fragments of the scenery. While the Ashwinder's eggs set fire to the floorboards, "Amata" and "Asha" started duelling fiercely. Professor Beery was caught in the crossfire and his head assumed unusual proportions. While the staff evacuated the Great Hall, the fire raging inside it threatened to engulf the place.[10] Of course, there were several people sent to the Hospital Wing and Professor Dippet had to put Professor Kettleburn in one of his sixty-two periods of probation. In response to this dramatic fiasco, Professor Dippet imposed a blanket ban on future pantomimes, a tradition that is still followed by the Hogwarts' staff and students to this day.[10]  Chamber of Secrets openings  "My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy… the death of that poor little girl. You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the — er — source of all this unpleasantness…" — Dippet regarding the closing Hogwarts after the Chamber of Secrets is opened[src]  Dippet was the Headmaster of Hogwarts when the Chamber of Secrets was opened by Tom Riddle, during the 1942—1943 school year. Very fond of Riddle, Dippet was unaware of his sinister nature.[6] That school year, many students were attacked by Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk. On 13 June of the same year, a student named Myrtle Warren was murdered in a bathroom,[6] during one of the Chamber's openings by Riddle.[14] After realising that no one had seen Myrtle for a couple of hours, Professor Dippet asked fellow student Olive Hornby to go and look for Myrtle.[15] Myrtle's Muggle father and mother were summoned to the school by Dippet, and the Headmaster faced the possibility of closing the school. Dippet also rejected Tom's request of staying at school over the summer holidays due to the situation, but would have given him special permission if the school were much safer.[6] Not wanting the school to close, or possibly not wanting to return to the orphanage, Riddle stopped attacking students with the Chamber's Basilisk and framed Rubeus Hagrid for the attacks, in which Dippet then promptly expelled Hagrid. Under Albus Dumbledore's request, Hagrid was trained as Gamekeeper and was allowed to remain at the school.[14]  Exchange visit with Castelobruxo During 1940s or 1950s, Hogwarts received students and Professor Benedita Dourado from Castelobruxo, the Brazilian wizarding school, during an exchange visit. When Dippet complained of Peeves, the resident poltergeist, Professor Dourado laughed heartily and offered to send him some Caipora for the Forbidden Forest "to show you what trouble really is". Naturally, Professor Dippet did not take her up on that offer.[16]  Tom Riddle's job application  "Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach... I had advised Armando against the appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty — but I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position of power." — Discussion of Riddle's application as DADA professor[src]  When Tom Riddle returned to Hogwarts after his graduation to apply for the post of professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts, after Galatea Merrythought retired, Dippet denied him the position for being too young, but invited him to reapply in a few years, despite being advised against it by Albus Dumbledore.[17] Dumbledore, at the time, had realised Riddle's true intentions, but did not include them as his reasons for denying him the job, as Professor Dippet was very fond of him and believed that he was completely honest.[17]  Death and post-mortem  "...Rita Skeeter, best-selling author of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?" — Cover of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore[src]      Dippet's Chocolate Frog Card   Professor Dippet's term as headmaster ended between March 1965 and March 1971.[8] His immediate successor in the post was Professor Albus Dumbledore,[6] who had been Dippet's Head of Transfiguration. The prominence of Dippet's tenure as Headmaster is highlighted by the fact that he even got a Chocolate Frog Card made in his effigy, due to his work as chief administrator of Hogwarts.[7] At some point, Rita Skeeter published her bestselling biography titled Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?,[18] which, given its title and Skeeter's own brand of sensationalist writing (elsewhere described as "one quarter truth to three quarters rubbish"),[19] it can be reasonably assumed that it contained false defamatory information, or otherwise facts taken out of context. In the 1 September 1992 edition of the Evening Prophet, he was being suspected of causing an accident only a month before his ancient age flying test on his 355th birthday. Dippet died in late 1992.[3] After his death,[3] the late Headmaster was allowed to leave behind an imprint of himself in the form of a portrait mounted on the wall of the Headmaster's office along with other revered Headmasters and Headmistress.[20] In doing this, he effectively ensured that he in some capacity could continue to posthumously serve the school by sharing his knowledge with his successors in office as a final service to his beloved school. The portrait he left behind presents him as very dignified and solemn-looking while attired in long, majestic robes of blue and bronze.[21] In 1995, he scorned the portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black, who was feigning tiredness in order to avoid going to 12 Grimmauld Place like Dumbledore asked him to. He was devoted to serving whoever was Headmaster.[22]  Physical description Professor Dippet had pale skin, brown eyes and, in his youth, a thick brown beard.[7] In his elderly years, he became frail and feeble-looking. He was balding and had only a few wisps of white hair left.[6]  Personality and traits As made evident by his portrait in the Headmaster's Office, he was apparently a very proud man who for the most part held himself with dignity and solemnity at all but the most trying of times, in which case he would, over time, look very feeble and tired after having to cope with such troubles at his age.  Very loyal to Hogwarts, Professor Dippet gave a certain impression of holding the school in higher regard than he did even his staff, as he was very distrusting of others, and Professor Albus Dumbledore, his Head of Transfiguration at during the later parts of Professor Dippet's tenure, noted that he was one of the few people that Professor Dippet confided in. He was also a man of tradition, having trained his portrait to scold anyone who showed lack of respect or loyalty to the school, which was shown when it reprimanded the portrait Phineas Nigellus's for attempting to defy a request from Professor Dumbledore, expressing that they were honour-bound to give advice to the current Headmaster or Headmistress, regardless of their personal feelings. Professor Dippet appeared to a disciplinarian, as corporal punishment was practised at the school during his tenure. Horace Slughorn once joked that Dippet might place him in detention if he found him letting students roam the school after hours at his Slug Club.[23] He also placed Professor Silvanus Kettleburn, whom he always considered to be quite reckless, on no fewer than sixty-two periods of probation for various incidents.[10] His concern for the well-being of his students was shown once more during the 1942-1943 school year, when he, like all his employees, did everything in his power to apprehend the perpetrator and protect the students after the opening of Chamber of Secrets.[6] During that year, it is known that he instructed a student by the name of Olive Hornby to go look for fellow student Myrtle Warren the moment he realised that no one had seen her for some time.[24] He also seemed to favour status, as he believed a prefect Tom Riddle over a younger Rubeus Hagrid, and even expelling him without putting much effort in investigating the matter when he was accused of opening the Chamber of Secrets. However, as the school at the time was dangerously near to being closed down by the Ministry of Magic after the murder on Myrtle, he was likely to have done so on account of having been under a lot of pressure. Although as Hagrid was allowed to stay at the school after his expulsion, Professor Dippet might have been a wise, well-meaning if somewhat strict administrator under pressure rather than mercilessly expelling one student on the word of another.  It is known that during his tenure at Hogwarts, Professor Dippet grew rather fond of Tom Riddle and was perhaps somewhat biased towards him, partly due to sympathising with the boy who had grown up orphaned and friendless and partly due to the young man's charisma. However, this did not blind him from keeping their safety his number one priority, nor did it stop him for keeping up certain standards.[6] This is shown when he rejected the request of a recent graduate to become a teacher on the basis of being too young,[17] as well as rejecting Tom Riddle's request of staying at school over the summer holidays due to the situation,[6] while unaware that Riddle was the one behind the danger Dippet wanted to protect him from. However, being fully aware that Riddle despised the orphanage where he was raised, he did comment that he would have given him special permission if the school was more safer at the time.[6]  Magical abilities and skills Magical mastery: Having been entrusted the task of overseeing the training of young witches and wizards at one of the eleven most prestigious schools of the world, Armando Dippet was a very great wizard with wide-reaching knowledge of and much proficiency in many different branches of magic. This was highlighted by the fact that the extent to which a portrait could interact with those that looked at it depended not on the skill of the painter, but rather on the power of the witch or wizard depicted,[25] and how the gallery of headteacher portraits in the Headmaster's Tower, including that of Professor Dippet, were all so lifelike that the Hogwarts Board of Governors found it prudent to remind new appointees to the post.[26] Leadership skills: While he never achieved the level of admiration and reverence of his immediate successor, Professor Dippet was nonetheless a very capable Headmaster of the school, and remembered as such by his tenure having been the theme of his Chocolate Frog Card. Possessions Wand: Professor Dippet's wand was of unknown manufacturer, length, core and wood. He was in possession of it during the 1940s. He left it on his desk during his meeting with Tom Riddle in 1943 concerning the summer holidays and the Chamber of Secrets openings.[27] Headmaster's office: When Professor Dippet presided in the office in the Headmaster's Tower, there was a single bookcase, a desk, and several paintings there, including the portraits of his predecessors. His passwords are unknown, though it can be presumed that he told one of them to Tom Riddle in 1943.[6] Strawberry and ling plantations: According to Albus Dumbledore, Professor Dippet planted some strawberries and ling in the castle grounds while he was Headmaster. However, it is likely that Albus was simply trying to distract Cornelius Fudge and Walden Macnair.[28] Relationships Tom Riddle  "I had advised Armando against the appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty..." — Dippet's fondness of Riddle[src] Dippet was very fond of Tom Riddle, whom he made several "special arrangements" for. His relationship with him was strong enough to make Dumbledore decide not to tell Dippet about why he thought Riddle should not be given a job at the school.[17] Hogwarts staff Professor Dippet was, apparently, distrusting of his employees, confiding only in a few professors, which included the Transfiguration teacher Albus Dumbledore.[17] As headmaster, Dippet placed Silvanus Kettleburn on at least one, but presumably many more, of his sixty-two periods of probation. The one known time was after he provided an Ashwinder with an Engorgement Charm on it instead of a worm for the The Fountain of Fair Fortune pantomime. Dippet, after the chaos, placed a permanent ban on pantomimes from there on.[10] Another of Dippet's employees was Herbert Beery, who was the one who adapted The Fountain of Fair Fortune into a play. Beery, who had been teaching Herbology, eventually left to become a professor of the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts.[10] Horace Slughorn also worked under Headmaster Dippet. One evening, during one of his Slug Club's supper parties, Slughorn joked that if the student group would be found up and about after hours, Professor Dippet would put them all in detention, including himself.[23]  Etymology "Armando" is the Spanish and Italian variant of the name Armand, meaning "of the army". It is likely that, given his name, Armando Dippet is at least partially of Spanish or Italian heritage. "Dippet" is not a word in English, but "dip" has many meanings, including: to put something into something else, often a liquid; to take something out of something, as in dipping out water; to lower and raise something; a fool. Behind the scenes Alfred Burke appeared as Dippet in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, in the memory scene. His face can be glimpsed only for a fleeting moment, before he turns around and convenes with several other wizards. He is also not bald contrary to the book's description.     The newspaper mentioning Dippet   In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Armando Dippet is mentioned in the Daily Prophet article FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. In the article, witches Leonora Gore and Daphne Mauboisan accuse Dippet, their neighbour, of causing the incident and not a flying car. Dippet is referred to as "a rather feeble old wizard", "well known for his erratic flying", and had his broomstick confiscated pending an ancient age flying test (a past occurrence, comprising a broomstick crash against Felicitania Tugwood, who fell off of her broom and into the River Mersey, is also cited). However, this canonicity of this article is open to dispute as the article changes subjects part-way through and becomes gibberish. If it is Headmaster Dippet mentioned in the article, he was the fourth-oldest known wizard, being born in 1637. The only known wizards older than him were Barry Wee Willie Winkle (b. 1236) and Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel (b. 1327 and 1334, respectively).[2] His wand may have been made out of pine wood, considering how pine wands tended to choose witches and wizards destined for long lives. Armando Dippet shares his first and last initials with Albus Dumbledore.

This places his date of birth in October 1637.  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2  In a scene in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets taking place on 1 September 1992, he was still living (see this image). His portrait's first appearance is in the Headmaster's office in May 1993 (see this image). According to J. K. Rowling at the 2004 Edinburgh Book Festival, all the portraits in Hogwarts are of deceased individuals. Harry Potter Limited Edition states he died in 1992 (see this image). He had to have died between 1 September and 31 December 1992.  ↑ According to Harry Potter Limited Edition, he died in 1992. So, he died before 31 December 1992. According to the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, he was still living in September, and was born in October. He was about to celebrate a 355th birthday, so if he died before his birthday he would have been aged 354.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 6.00 6.01 6.02 6.03 6.04 6.05 6.06 6.07 6.08 6.09 6.10 6.11 6.12 6.13 6.14 6.15 6.16 6.17 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 13 (The Very Secret Diary)  ↑ 7.0 7.1 7.2 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)  ↑ 8.0 8.1 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Chapter 18 (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs) Remus Lupin - "I was a very small boy when I received the bite...But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic." Writing by J. K. Rowling: "Remus Lupin" at Wizarding World - Lupin was attacked shortly before his fifth birthday (March 1965) and Headmaster Dumbledore comes to visit shortly before his eleventh birthday (March 1971) so Dumbledore succeeded Dippet as headmaster during this time.  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 16 (Godric's Hollow) The portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black, who tenure came sometime before Dippet's, states that he was the last Slytherin Head of Hogwarts before Snape.  ↑ 10.0 10.1 10.2 10.3 10.4 10.5 10.6 10.7 The Tales of Beedle the Bard - "The Fountain of Fair Fortune" - Albus Dumbledore's notes  ↑ Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 5 (An Excess of Phlegm)  ↑ Writing by J.

Rowling: "Professor McGonagall" at Wizarding World  ↑ The Daily Prophet, 29 November 1926, states that "Headmaster calls for emergency meeting with worried parents" and that he sent "students home early" in the same year.
