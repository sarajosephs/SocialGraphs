This attained such proportions that it ended up in her being forced to step down on 17 February, 1858, after such incidents as coins turning to frogspawn in his coat pockets.[1] Ironically, Palmerston was forced to resign by the Muggles two days later on 19 February, 1858.[1] He was later reelected on 12 June, 1859 and died in office.[2]  Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 Writing by J.
