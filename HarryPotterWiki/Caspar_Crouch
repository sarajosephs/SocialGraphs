The couple had three children: a son and two daughters.[3] He might have been the father of Bartemius Crouch Snr, though this is unconfirmed. His name appeared on the Black family tree tapestry.  Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Name seen on Black family tree tapestry) Notes and references   ↑ In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 36 (The Parting of the Ways), Dumbledore refers to Bartemius Crouch Jnr as "the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any" meaning that all other members of the family were dead by 1995.  ↑ The Blacks were known to only have married Pure-bloods  ↑ Black family tree              Categories         Categories:   20th century deaths    British individuals    Crouch family    House of Black    Males    Married individuals    Parents    Pure-bloods    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Deutsch Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
