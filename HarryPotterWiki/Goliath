He was ultimately slain by a young boy armed only with a sling.[1]  Behind the scenes Goliath is based on the Biblical figure of the same name, recorded in the book 1 Samuel of the Old Testament. His defeat is commonly attributed to King David but other sources suggest that this may not have been the case. The Chocolate Frog Card for Goliath only refers to the giant's slayer as a "young boy" without explicitly naming David. It is thus possible that Goliath was not slain by David in the Harry Potter universe. Giants in the Harry Potter universe are said to be between twenty and twenty five feet tall. According to a common version of the story, Goliath's height was "6 cubits and 1 span" (about 9 feet 6 inches), making him extremely short by giant standards, though still taller than the tallest recorded human. This suggests that he may have been a Half-giant. Other interpretations of the passage place his height at "4 cubits and 1 span" (6 feet 6 inches), a more realistic height for a human who was still very tall by the standards of the time, making the term "Giant" descriptive. Though David's weapon is sometimes depicted as a catapult, historically it was more likely to have been a sling weapon.
