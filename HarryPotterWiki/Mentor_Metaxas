Shortly before the match started, he was spotted by Daily Prophet reporter Rita Skeeter chatting to the President of the Argentinian Council of Magic, Valentina Vázquez.[1]  Behind the scenes If this individual's name is indication of anything, he is probably Greek or of Greek descent — the name "Mentor" is an Ancient Greek name that features in Greek Mythology,[2] and the surname Metaxas is also Greek: Greek archicted and marksman Anastasios Metaxas (1862-1937), Greek politician Andreas Metaxas (1790-1860), and Greek general and dictator Ioannis Metaxas (1871–1941) are some notable people who bore this surname.
