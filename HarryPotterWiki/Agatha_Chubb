She used this discovery to demonstrate how modern wizards developed Bludgers from lead and then iron, as lead was determined too soft a metal for the purpose of the balls.[1] She wrote, "They are undoubtedly Bludgers rather than cannon balls. The faint indentations of magically reinforced Beaters' bats are visible and one can see the distinctive hallmarks of manufacture by a wizard (as opposed to a Muggle) - the smoothness of line, the perfect symmetry. A final clue was the fact that each and every one of them whizzed around my study and attempted to knock me to the floor when released from its case."[1]  Etymology "Agatha" is a Latinized form of the Greek name Αγαθη (Agathe), derived from Greek αγαθος (agathos) meaning "good". Saint Agatha was a 3rd-century martyr from Sicily who was tortured and killed after spurning the advances of a Roman official. The saint was widely revered in the Middle Ages, and her name has been used throughout Christian Europe (in various spellings). The mystery writer Agatha Christie (1890–1976) was a famous modern bearer of this name.
