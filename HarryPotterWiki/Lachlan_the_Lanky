A statue of him was located on the Seventh floor of Hogwarts Castle.[1] Ronald Weasley once hid behind this statue to avoid being found by Fred and George Weasley, whom he felt would tease him for trying out for the position of Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.[1]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 13 (Detention with Dolores)     Seventh-floor of Hogwarts Castle   Bathrooms   Disused bathroom   Classrooms   Classroom 7B · Classroom 7C · Divination Classroom   Common Rooms   Gryffindor Boys' Dormitory · Gryffindor Common Room · Gryffindor Girls' Dormitory   Corridors   Divination corridor · Fat Lady's Corridor · Hall of Hexes · Porticus Olidus · Pungent Passage · Runic Corridor · Seventh-floor corridor   Halls and rooms   Bean Challenge rooms · Gryffindor Tower reading room · Knights' Room · North Wing   Offices   Filius Flitwick's office · Sybill Trelawney's office   Other locations   Dark Tower topmost cell · Room of Requirement   Portraits, statues and other artwork   A Young Professor McGonagall · Bridget Wenlock · Sir Cadogan · Caged monkey · Edward Rabnott · Elephant · Elizabeth Burke · Fat Lady · Flowering almond trees · George von Rheticus · Giraffe · Godric Gryffindor · Healers · Hippopotamus · Journeying wizards · Lachlan the Lanky · Mother and baby · Oraclitus Spheer · Staring Portrait · The Lady and the Unicorn · Three young ladies · Tiger · Troll Tapestry · Two lovers in a graveyard · Valeria Myriadd · Wailing Egyptians · Witch flying to the moon · Wizard in black flowing robes · Wizard in blue · Wizard with a broomstick · Wolfhound   Staircases   Detention Escape Route · Divination Stairwell · Grand Staircase · Grumpy Staircase · Ravenclaw Tower staircase · Secret stairway to the fourth floor · Slughorn's Staircase · Staircase to the sixth-floor corridor · Turris Magnus staircase   Storerooms   Attic             Categories         Categories:   Historical figures    Males    Statues    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
