This makes him a distant relative of the famous Harry Potter, a fact which would be uncovered by eager genealogists centuries later.[2] After completing a surely arduous process, Abraham became an Auror. He was, along with eleven other wizards and witches, one of the first Aurors in the United States of America, being recruited by Josiah Jackson, the first President of MACUSA. He died before reaching "old age".[2]  Behind the scenes Despite being a Potter, Abraham was not featured on the Potter family tree on  Pottermore.[3] It is likely that Abraham had descendants. However, it remains unknown whether Harry is aware of their existence. Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) (Appears as a picture of his statue) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ To be an Auror, Abraham presumably had to be at least seventeen to legally use a wand outside of Ilvermorny and not break Wizarding Laws. As well as this, MACUSA was founded in 1693; seventeen years prior is 1676.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 Writing by J. K.
