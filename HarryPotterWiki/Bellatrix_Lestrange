I was and am the Dark Lord's most loyal servant. I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete!" — Bellatrix about her loyalty and skills in the Dark Arts[src]  Bellatrix "Bella" Lestrange (née Black) (1951 – 2 May, 1998) was a British Pure-blood witch, the eldest daughter of Cygnus and Druella Black, cousin of Regulus and Sirius Black, and the elder sister of Andromeda Tonks and Narcissa Malfoy. She was a member of the House of Black, an old wizarding family and one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Bellatrix started her education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early sixties (either 1962 or 1963), and was Sorted into Slytherin House. After graduating from Hogwarts, Bellatrix became a Death Eater. She was fanatically loyal to Lord Voldemort and was among the most dangerous and sadistic of his followers. All the Black sisters married pure-blood wizards, except for Andromeda who married Muggle-born Ted Tonks and was disowned by the family.  After Voldemort's fall from power, Bellatrix, her husband Rodolphus Lestrange, her brother-in-law Rabastan Lestrange, and Barty Crouch Jnr captured and tortured the Aurors Frank and Alice Longbottom, seeking information about Voldemort's whereabouts which eventually drove the two Aurors insane. The four Death Eaters were caught and sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. Voldemort eventually returned to full strength in 1995 and Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan escaped from Azkaban in the 1996 mass break-out, along with seven other Death Eaters. Bellatrix participated in several battles of the Second Wizarding War, making it a particular goal to murder any relatives who were members of the Order of the Phoenix. She successfully murdered two, her cousin Sirius Black and niece Nymphadora Tonks. She also murdered the Malfoy family's former house-elf, Dobby, who had become a firm ally of Harry Potter. During the final battle, Bellatrix was the last Death Eater standing. She was eventually killed in a duel by Molly Weasley after her attempted murder of Ginny Weasley. Before her death, Bellatrix secretly gave birth to an illegitimate daughter named Delphini, whom she conceived with her beloved master, Lord Voldemort. Delphini was conceived sometime after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996 and before Bellatrix's death at the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.[14]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Early life (1951–1970) 1.2 First Wizarding War (1970–1981) 1.3 Between the wars (1981–1995)  1.3.1 Imprisonment   1.4 Second Wizarding War (1995–1998)  1.4.1 Escape from Azkaban 1.4.2 Battle of the Department of Mysteries 1.4.3 Plot against Albus Dumbledore 1.4.4 Battle of the Seven Potters 1.4.5 Skirmish at Malfoy Manor 1.4.6 Duel with Molly Weasley  1.4.6.1 Death     1.5 Legacy (1998–)   2 Physical appearance 3 Personality and traits 4 Magical abilities and skills 5 Possessions 6 Relationships  6.1 Family  6.1.1 Narcissa Malfoy 6.1.2 Delphini 6.1.3 Malfoy family 6.1.4 Rodolphus Lestrange 6.1.5 Andromeda Tonks and Sirius Black 6.1.6 Nymphadora Tonks 6.1.7 Regulus Black   6.2 Lord Voldemort 6.3 Severus Snape 6.4 Death Eaters 6.5 Kreacher 6.6 Harry Potter 6.7 Longbottom family 6.8 Albus Dumbledore 6.9 Hermione Granger 6.10 Order of the Phoenix and enemies   7 Media 8 Etymology 9 Behind the scenes 10 Appearances 11 Notes and references   Biography Early life (1951–1970)  "Snape... was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters. Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges — they're a married couple — they're in Azkaban." — Bellatrix's time at Hogwarts was spent among a select group of Slytherins.[src]  Bellatrix was born in 1951 to Cygnus Black III and Druella Rosier, who gave her a rich lifestyle and raised her to be proud of her pure-blood heritage. She was the elder sister of Andromeda and Narcissa Black.[1] Bellatrix attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Slytherin House, a patron followed by her sisters.       A young Bellatrix (middle) with her younger sisters, Narcissa and Andromeda   Along with the rest of her family who held pureblood supremacy beliefs, Bellatrix cut off contact with Andromeda when she married Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks, causing her to be disowned from the House of Black. Neither she or Narcissa had "set eyes on Andromeda since she married the Mudblood Tonks".[3] She also held her cousin Sirius Black in contempt for being a "blood traitor", due to his different opinions on Muggles and Muggle-borns.  Bellatrix eventually married Rodolphus Lestrange, a fellow wealthy pure-blood and Slytherin, marrying out of obligation of fulfilling her family's pro pure-blood mentality and tradition. Unlike her sisters, she never displayed any affection for her husband whatsoever, never even mentioning him in conversations nor bearing him any children. When Lord Voldemort first rose to power, Bellatrix and Rodolphus joined the Death Eaters. At some point, she received training in the Dark Arts from Voldemort himself.[4] He was the one to whom she spoke in a romantic manner. However, he never returned her feelings as he was incapable of understanding love and disliked the idea of being emotionally attached to anyone.  First Wizarding War (1970–1981)  "The Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!" — Bellatrix's parting words to the Council of Magical Law[src]  When the First Wizarding War broke out, Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus along with her brother-in law Rabastan became Death Eaters and fought for Voldemort. The pair remained loyal to the Dark Lord throughout the war, even after he was "defeated" by the infant Harry Potter.      Bellatrix is tried before the Council of Magical Law, along with her husband, her brother-in-law, and Barty Crouch Jnr   After the Dark Lord's fall on 31 October, 1981, Bellatrix and a group of Voldemort's followers, including Rodolphus, her brother-in-law Rabastan, and Barty Crouch Jnr, managed to avoid capture or execution by Aurors. Seeking to find and revive their master, the group kidnapped Aurors and Order of the Phoenix members Alice and Frank Longbottom, just new parents to Neville Longbottom. She and her partners used the Cruciatus Curse to torture the couple for information on Voldemort's whereabouts, until the two captives were driven into insanity when they refused to divulge anything.  This incident happened when Neville was only a baby. Frank and Alice were placed in the Janus Thickey Ward for irrevocable spell damage at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries and, due to them undergoing extreme torture, were rendered unaware that they had a son together.[15][4]  Between the wars (1981–1995) Imprisonment     Bellatrix while imprisoned in Azkaban   This crime caused a wave of fury upon the wizard community of such ferocity that the Ministry of Magic were critically pressured to find the culprits. When the four were captured, they were tried before the Council of Magical Law and sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. Unlike many other Death Eaters, Bellatrix didn't lie about her loyalty — she proudly claimed that she was loyal to Voldemort and that she would wait for his return.[15] Marked as Prisoner 93, Bellatrix was sentenced to life in Azkaban with no chance of release. For her actions, she later described herself as the Dark Lord's most loyal follower and even Lord Voldemort, whom she admired the most, gained a considerable amount of respect for her. Her fifteen years in a maximum security cell took a toll on her mentally, as it did with so many, as well as hollowing out her appearance until only the faintest traces of her familial beauty remained.[4] Harry Potter later witnessed Bellatrix's trial in 1995 in a memory of Professor Dumbledore's.[4]  Second Wizarding War (1995–1998) Escape from Azkaban  "Bellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom'." — The Daily Prophet's report on her notorious record, regarding her escape from Azkaban[src]      Voldemort breaks Bellatrix out of Azkaban after fifteen years of imprisonment   When Voldemort returned to power in June 1995, he said that Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan Lestrange were faithful members of his inner circle and should be rewarded, as they didn't denounce him even after they were captured and tried.[15] In January 1996, a mass breakout from Azkaban set ten long-imprisoned Death Eaters loose. Bellatrix was one of the ten who escaped in the mass breakout and rejoined Voldemort, as well as the Dementors whom Albus Dumbledore correctly predicted would side with Voldemort.[4] The Daily Prophet (probably with encouragement from the Ministry of Magic) reported that the escaped criminal Sirius Black must be responsible for the incident. These ten were considered to be some of the most dangerous and highly guarded convicts due to their crimes being brutal and legendary. As a result, Bellatrix and her allies became wanted witches and wizards, living in hiding to avoid being captured by the Ministry.[4]  Battle of the Department of Mysteries Main article: Battle of the Department of Mysteries  "Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy? You need to mean them, Potter. You need to really want to cause pain — to enjoy it — righteous anger won't hurt me for long — I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson — Crucio!" — Bellatrix teaching Harry Potter a lesson on the Unforgivable Curses[src]      Neville Longbottom threatening Bellatrix in the Hall of Prophecy   Later that very same year, Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan were all members of a Death Eater task force led by Lucius Malfoy. They participated in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, a plot to steal a prophecy regarding Harry Potter and the Dark Lord. She was enraged when Harry spoke Voldemort's given name and mentioned his true status as a half-blood. This enraged her so much that she actually tried to stun him before Lucius deflected her spell with a Shield Charm, not wanting to inadvertently harm the prophecy they were sent to retrieve. She was very condescending when dealing with the six D.A. members. Bellatrix tried unsuccessfully to retrieve the prophecy from Harry Potter via a Summoning Charm, as her efforts were stopped by Harry's quick use of his own Shield Charm. However, she was willing to do whatever it took to get the prophecy from Harry, including gleefully and sadistically threatening to torture fourteen year old Ginny Weasley with the Cruciatus Curse while he was forced to watch.[4]      Harry, Dumbledore, and Lupin watch as Bellatrix kills Sirius Black   When the Order of the Phoenix members arrived, Bellatrix duelled and defeated her niece, Nymphadora Tonks. She then began fighting her cousin Sirius Black who proceeded to taunt her during the course of their duel but she then struck him with a spell that sent him through the veil in the Death Chamber, killing him. After Sirius's death, Bellatrix defeated Kingsley Shacklebolt before deciding to flee.[4] Driven into a rage at the loss of his godfather, Harry pursued her all the way to the Atrium in an attempt to avenge him. After hideously mocking his relationship with Sirius, Harry attempted to use the Cruciatus Curse on her but only knocked her over causing her a few seconds of pain. Dropping her jeering manner, Bellatrix disdainfully lectured him on his failure to execute the curse effectively (inadvertently teaching him how to do it properly in the future) before resolving to torture him herself with it in order to demonstrate the full potency of the curse. After unsuccessfully attempting to attack Harry, she discovered to her horror that the prophecy had been destroyed and proceeded to panic, repeatedly attempting to summon it in vain from Harry who laughed at her efforts and dismissed her pleadings for leniency from her master due to being unaware that the latter had just arrived at the Ministry.[4]      Bellatrix pleading with Voldemort after the Prophecy was smashed   Once Harry realised that Voldemort was indeed present, Bellatrix pleaded with her master not to be punished and tried to warn him that Dumbledore was nearby, but he ignored her and concentrated on attempting to kill Harry. As the Killing Curse blasted from the end of his wand towards Harry, Dumbledore arrived and enchanted the statues of the Fountain of Magical Brethren to protect Harry, act as reinforcements, and to ensure that Bellatrix couldn't intervene as she was then pinned to the ground by the newly sentient witch statue. However, she was the sole Death Eater to escape being captured by effectively blocking the spell that he had attempted to cast upon her.[4] Before duelling Voldemort, Dumbledore summoned Cornelius Fudge and several Aurors to the Ministry using the statues as messengers via the fireplaces along the Atrium wall. After a failed attempt at possessing Harry, Voldemort grabbed Bellatrix before Apparating away but not before being seen by Fudge and the Aurors. With the rest of the Death Eaters immobilised and caught by the Ministry only moments later, Bellatrix was the only Death Eater not to be apprehended due to Voldemort intervening on her behalf, a testament to his acknowledgement of her loyalty to him.[4] Sometime following this, Bellatrix would secretly engage in a sexual relationship with Voldemort. Out of this union would be born their daughter Delphini, who would be given over to be raised by the Rowle family, a family sworn to Voldemort.[16]  Plot against Albus Dumbledore  "He lives here? Here? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot — Cissy, wait!" — Bellatrix arriving in Spinner's End for the first time with her sister Narcissa[src]      Bellatrix sealing the Unbreakable Vow between Narcissa and Snape   In July of 1996, Bellatrix reluctantly accompanied her younger sister, Narcissa Malfoy, to the house of Severus Snape at Spinner's End. Once there, Bellatrix interrogated Snape and voiced her distrust of him. Snape's calm, reasonable, and logical answers to her aggressive questioning rendered her dissatisfied, but temporarily without retort. However, Narcissa proceeded to beg Snape to look after her son Draco's welfare while he attended Hogwarts and tried to fulfil Voldemort's orders to kill Dumbledore. Snape shocked Bellatrix by asking her to bind him and Narcissa with an Unbreakable Vow to assist Draco.[5] Furthermore, Bellatrix assisted her nephew in his task by teaching him Occlumency, a tool he used against Snape in order to conceal the details of his mission.[17] She showed her obsessive loyalty to her master's cause in telling her sister that she should be proud, instead of being worried, that her son was not "shrinking away from his duty."[5]  Battle of the Seven Potters Main article: Meeting at Malfoy Manor  Bellatrix: "My Lord, it is an honour to have you here, in our family's house. There can be no higher pleasure." Lord Voldemort: "No higher pleasure... That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you." Bellatrix: "My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!" — Bellatrix's delight at Voldemort staying at Malfoy Manor[src]      Bellatrix attending a Death Eater meeting at Malfoy Manor   By the next year, Bellatrix was living with Narcissa at Malfoy Manor. She was the only resident of the manor who was actually pleased that Voldemort was staying there, telling him that there was "no higher pleasure". Despite her unwavering loyalty, her master humiliated her and the Malfoys by mentioning the marriage of Nymphadora Tonks, the daughter of their sister, to the werewolf Remus Lupin. However, Bellatrix insisted that she and Narcissa didn't consider Nymphadora to be their niece, as they had disowned their sister for marrying a Muggle-born.       Bellatrix is informed that she must "prune her family tree" by killing Tonks   Voldemort eventually stopped the teasing and advised Bellatrix to continue to "prune" her "family tree", which she eagerly agreed to do as soon as possible. Despite her proclaimed loyalty towards her master, even Bellatrix hesitated when Voldemort said that he would need to borrow a wand from them in order to circumvent the problem of his own wand refusing to kill Harry, looking much like her colleagues "as though he had asked to borrow one of their arms".[3] When the Death Eaters subsequently attacked the Order of the Phoenix while they were moving Harry Potter from 4 Privet Drive, Bellatrix and her husband pursued a disguised Ronald Weasley and Tonks, whom Bellatrix tried very hard to kill. However, Rodolphus was injured in the pursuit and Tonks escaped. Soon afterwards, a copy of Godric Gryffindor's Sword was secured in Bellatrix's family vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank with Bellatrix and the Death Eaters unaware that it was merely a copy. The goblins who ran the bank noticed at once that it was not the genuine article, but neglected to mention it to Bellatrix owing to their disdain at the new wizard control of their bank.[3]  Skirmish at Malfoy Manor Main article: Skirmish at Malfoy Manor  "You're lying, you filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth! What else did you take? What else have you got? Tell me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife! What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!" — Overheard parts of Bellatrix's interrogation of Hermione Granger[src]      Bellatrix sees the Sword of Gryffindor and retaliates against the Snatchers who possess it   In March 1998, when Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were captured by a group of Snatchers and brought to the manor, Bellatrix was at first eager to make sure that Voldemort was informed right away and she and Lucius briefly argued over who would summon him. When she spotted Godric Gryffindor's Sword amongst the trio's captured possessions, however, she at once flew into a panic because the sword (as far as she knew) was hidden in her vault. This led Harry to deduce that there could be something of great importance in her vault which ended up being one of Voldemort's Horcruxes: Helga Hufflepuff's Cup. Bellatrix, coming out of her panicked state, ordered the Snatcher holding the sword to hand it over to her and stunned the man when he refused.  The other Snatchers turned on her at once, but even though it was four on one, they were no match for her and she quickly stunned three of them and forced Greyback to his knees, demanding to know where he had found the sword. He then informed her that the sword had been found in the Trio's tent. She then took charge of the situation by resorting to torturing Hermione into revealing how the sword was in the Trio's possession and demanded that the rest of the prisoners be taken into the cellar temporarily, while ordering the Stunned Snatchers to be placed in the courtyard to be disposed of by her personally at a later time.[3]      Bellatrix brutally torturing Hermione Granger with the Cruciatus Curse   Bellatrix proceeded to brutally torture Hermione with the Cruciatus Curse, asking her again and again about the Sword and if they had taken anything else from their vault. Even in extreme pain, Hermione managed to lie, claiming the real sword was only a copy.[3] However, Bellatrix doubted this claim, which led to Lucius suggesting that Draco retrieve the goblin prisoner Griphook from the cellar to tell her if the sword was a fake or not. Griphook also managed to lie, obeying Harry's request to not tell Bellatrix the truth, keeping the trio's secret safe. After Peter Pettigrew (who had been sent to check on the prisoners after hearing a suspicious noise) was strangled to death in the cellar with his own silver hand given to him by Voldemort after showing mercy to Harry and Ron escaped the cellar and proceeded up the stairs to aid Hermione.[3]      Bellatrix pressing her silver dagger to Hermione Granger's throat   Bellatrix threatened Hermione with her knife, after Harry stunned Greyback and Lucius and Ron disarmed her. While holding the knife to an unconscious Hermione's throat, Bellatrix demanded that the prisoners drop their wands, and then pressed her Dark Mark, calling Voldemort. However, Dobby (who had been sent by Aberforth Dumbledore to rescue Harry and his friends) created a diversion by causing the chandelier to fall from above Bellatrix's head, making her release Hermione and jump out of the way. She lashed out at the house-elf in complete disbelief of his rebellious action to his "former masters". Dobby claimed he was a "free elf" and Disapparated. As the house-elf Disapparated with Harry, Bellatrix threw a silver knife at them in a desperate attempt to prevent their escape, and the Apparition sucked up the knife with it, wounding Dobby in his chest, who then died. She also lost her wand in the skirmish.[3]      Bellatrix throwing her silver dagger at Dobby   Bellatrix and her relatives were severely punished by Voldemort for allowing Harry to escape. After the incident at Malfoy Manor, Hermione used a hair of Bellatrix that had fallen on her while she was torturing her to change herself into Bellatrix using Polyjuice Potion, therefore letting her sneak into Gringotts, as Diagon Alley was infested with Death Eaters.[3]  Duel with Molly Weasley  "NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!" — Molly Weasley challenges Bellatrix[src]  During the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May 1998, Bellatrix finally succeeded in murdering Nymphadora Tonks, her estranged sister's daughter.[12] When Voldemort called a temporary retreat, waiting for Harry Potter to turn himself in, she waited by his side and offered him help when he was dazed after using the Killing Curse on Harry, but this offer was coldly rebuffed. Bellatrix eagerly asked Voldemort if she could check Harry for signs of life, but was refused again and he instead sent her younger sister to confirm his death. When Narcissa had lied and told Voldemort that Harry was dead, Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters followed Voldemort to Hogwarts to announce Harry's "death", gloating at the despair of the survivors.[3]      Bellatrix almost murders Ginny Weasley during the second half of the battle   When the battle resumed, Bellatrix fought Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood all at once, having become the last Death Eater standing aside from Voldemort, who was also fighting three opponents. It was said that despite all three young witches being skilled and working in tandem, together they did not outclass her. She cast a Killing Curse at Ginny, which narrowly missed its mark by an inch. The act was witnessed by both an invisible Harry, who was infuriated enough to actually target Bellatrix over Voldemort, and Molly Weasley.       Bellatrix duelling Molly Weasley during the second half of the final battle   The Weasley matriarch, having already lost one child that night and distraught at the prospect of losing her only daughter, promptly threw off her cloak and shouted a vocal challenge to the Death Eater as she charged forward, causing Bellatrix to cackle with laughter at her. However, Bellatrix's reckless, arrogant laughter quickly turned to rage as Molly began to attack, making her realise her opponent was more formidable than she had expected. The two began to duel with the intensity of their powers being stated as causing the ground beneath them to become hot and cracked due to their intent to finish the other off once and for all.[3]  Death  "Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart. Bellatrix's gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: for the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed." — Description of Bellatrix's demise at the hands of Molly Weasley[src]      Bellatrix's corpse at the feet of Molly Weasley   Despite Molly duelling fiercely, Bellatrix continued to laugh and mock her opponent with sadistic glee. She did this even as Molly's powerful curses missed her by inches, eventually providing an opening for Molly to strike her in the chest with a curse which proved fatal.  As her body toppled to the ground, an outraged Voldemort turned on Molly, which prompted Harry (who had watched the battle unfold beneath his Invisibility Cloak) to reveal himself. The final showdown between him and Voldemort ensued, but Bellatrix didn't live to find out that her mistrust of Snape had been valid or see her master's final defeat moments later.[3]  Legacy (1998–) Although it is unknown what happened to her body following the Battle of Hogwarts, it is possible that if Bellatrix was not cremated or buried in Great Britain, she might have been sent to France to be buried and laid to rest alongside the countless other members of the Lestrange family in the family's mausoleum at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.  During the Calamity which occurred in 2010s across the wizarding world, a portrait of Bellatrix escaped Malfoy Manor as one of the many Foundables, for unknown and mysterious reasons.[18]  Physical appearance  "A woman with thick, shining dark hair, long eyelashes and heavily hooded eyes... was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne." — Bellatrix's outward appearance at her trial[src]      Bellatrix, age 46/47   Bellatrix had the classic "great good looks" and arrogant bearing common for members of the House of Black. She was a tall woman with long, thick, shiny dark hair. Her face had a strong jaw,[5] a thin mouth,[4] and heavily lidded eyes with long eyelashes.[15] As a Death Eater, Bellatrix bore the Dark Mark on her left inner forearm. However, (like her cousin Sirius Black) her lengthy imprisonment in Azkaban took a toll on her appearance. Her face became gaunt and skull-like, but she still managed to retain vestiges of her great beauty.[4] There was a remarkable resemblance between Bellatrix and her sisters — at first glance, Harry mistook Andromeda Tonks for Bellatrix, being was only upon closer observation did he notice the differences (Andromeda had lighter brown hair, a kinder face, and wider eyes). Besides this, Narcissa Malfoy was as fair as Bellatrix was dark.[5]  Personality and traits  "Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I'll do it." — Bellatrix gleefully threatens to torture Ginny Weasley[src]  Bellatrix was an intensely sadistic witch with brutal, violent tendencies.[4][3] She possessed a fierce and dangerous temper, a trait that she shared with her cousin Sirius and her aunt Walburga and which was likely a result of the inbreeding that plagued her birth family. Bellatrix was one of Voldemort's cruellest Death Eaters, always eager to inflict the Cruciatus Curse on enemies. Harry Potter noted that she was as "mad as her master."[4] Likely for these reasons, Bellatrix was slavishly devoted to Lord Voldemort and was willing to do anything for his cause. She believed to have proven her loyalty by her time in Azkaban, an event which had seemingly furthered her mental decline.[15] Despite her loyalty towards her master she was able to disagree with him on occasion. She did not trust Severus Snape, and believed that Voldemort was mistaken in doing so, though she showed shame and fear when expressing this.[5]      Bellatrix sadistically laughing at the announcement of Harry Potter's "death"   Overall, Bellatrix was obsessed with blood purity and took immense pride in the aristocracy of her family since a young age. Like all the rest of Lord Voldemort's followers, she was vehemently against all half-bloods, Muggle-borns, Muggles, and half-breeds. She had a particular disdain for blood traitors, not being above killing members of her own family who displeased her, including her cousin Sirius and her younger sister's daughter Nymphadora, whom she sought to kill with great determination. Given her reaction to Harry's words that Voldemort is a half-blood, it is likely that she didn't know that her master wasn't a pure-blood or at least was in denial.       Bellatrix ruthlessly holding Hermione Granger at knife point   Bellatrix was intelligent and a natural leader, taking charge in tricky situations. These traits were shown during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor. The latter event was a mark of her decisiveness and ruthlessness, as she took no unnecessary prisoners (preferring to kill them instead), as she planned to do with a group of Snatchers who attempted to defy her.[3] However, Bellatrix could be easily distracted and reckless, especially in battle with opponents that appeared to be (or were) weaker than herself.  Bellatrix was also egotistical and arrogant, described by Harry as "treat[ing] everyone like scum" in a rather taunting way. She had immense confidence in her skills and never hesitated to jump into battle against any auror or Order of the Phoenix member. Furthermore, she was immensely proud of her status as the most loyal and devoted follower of Lord Voldemort. However, Bellatrix chose to flee when Dumbledore arrived, suggesting that, like her master, she held a degree of fear and caution for the powerful wizard. Despite her cruel personality, Bellatrix was not incapable of caring for a few people. She was obsessively in love with her master, Lord Voldemort. She had a close relationship with her younger sister Narcissa Malfoy, grudgingly going with her to Snape's house to ask his help and didn't tell her master of her sister's deception. She also showed affection for her nephew and student Draco Malfoy, but didn't seem to be too concerned about his safety as she would "be glad to give [her own sons] up to the service of the Dark Lord".  Magical abilities and skills  "She was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience." — Harry Potter regarding Bellatrix's duelling skills[src]  Bellatrix Lestrange was an extremely powerful and dangerous witch, trained by Lord Voldemort himself. She was a mistress of the Dark Arts, an incredibly skilful duellist, and an experienced Occlumens. Her unbalanced mental state and emotional instability seemed to feed her power and her prodigious magical skill was proven by her many victories over numerous talented wizards and witches, including experienced Aurors.    "That was just a taster! Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!" — Bellatrix after having tortured Neville Longbottom with the Cruciatus Curse[src]  Dark Arts: Bellatrix claimed to have been trained in the Dark Arts by Voldemort himself, boasting to Harry Potter that she had knowledge of "spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete!" ;[4] a claim supported by her status as Voldemort's "best lieutenant". Bellatrix displayed particular proficiency with the Cruciatus Curse, which was her signature spell. She preferred to torture her victims rather than killing them straight away, doing so with such skill her victims would pass out or would lose their sanity after prolonged exposure to the curse. Following her first duel against Nymphadora Tonks, the latter had to spend some time at St Mungo's, suggesting that her aunt cursed her in such a way that couldn't be cured easily.[4] Like her master, Bellatrix was capable of casting the Killing Curse with no regard for the life she wished to extinguish. She effectively killed a fox on her way to Spinner's End in 1996 with this curse,[5] and nearly killed Ginny Weasley with it in the Battle of Hogwarts.[3] Duelling: Bellatrix Lestrange was an incredibly accomplished and lethal duellist, noted for her "prodigious skill".[3] She presumably took part in many battles during the First Wizarding War and duelled against Aurors and Order of the Phoenix members alike. She was able to capture the notoriously powerful Frank and Alice Longbottom, though with help from three other Death Eaters. She defeated and seriously injured Nymphadora Tonks and Kingsley Shacklebolt in duels during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and killed her cousin Sirius Black. She was the only Death Eater to escape from Albus Dumbledore himself, though she was later dispatched by the headmaster's animated statues in the latter's duel against her master.[4] Despite her years of captivity within Azkaban, Bellatrix displayed incredible reflexes that outmatched the much younger and physically-fit Harry Potter, repelling and redirecting his Stunning Spell back towards him with a swiftly cast shield charm. She later participated in the Battle of Seven Potters, where she viciously hunted down Tonks and Ron Weasley, though they were able to hold her off and escape albeit with great difficulty. She quickly and single-handedly defeated four Snatchers at Malfoy Manor who were all described to be "no match for her", including the notoriously savage werewolf Fenrir Greyback.[4] During the Battle of Hogwarts, Bellatrix survived the first part of the battle with no injuries, finally succeeded in murdering Tonks and duelling against (and likely defeating) several other Hogwarts defenders. She also duelled Hermione Granger, Luna Lovegood, and Ginny Weasley all at once, being able to stalemate their combined efforts. She seemed to be getting the upper hand when she attempted to murder Ginny, given her Killing Curse missed Ginny by "an inch". Her death at the hands of Molly Weasley was due to her vastly underestimating the witch, who was fuelled by grief over the murder of her son, and was nonetheless a skilled witch in her own right.[3] She was the last Death Eater standing apart from Lord Voldemort, despite wielding a wand which she had most likely not won the allegiance of, which is further evidence of her extraordinary duelling skills. Nonverbal magic: Bellatrix was shown to have been highly adept at casting non-verbal spells, especially dark charms. She fired several destructive curses at Harry Potter without speaking their incantations aloud in the Atrium at the Ministry of Magic. During her duel with Molly Weasley, the intensity was such that the floor around them became "hot and cracked",[3] all without uttering a single incantation. Charms: Bellatrix displayed a high amount of proficiency in charms, given how she was able to cast the Summoning Charm, Stunning Spell and the Shield Charm effortlessly and successfully. She was able to block Harry's stunning spell using a Shield Charm with lightning speed, and furthermore using it to block an attack from Albus Dumbledore (an incredibly powerful wizard) with great success, showing her considerable talent in this field.[4]  "Ah... Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see." — Snape acknowledging Bellatrix's training of Draco in Occlumency[src]  Occlumency: Bellatrix was an experienced Occulmens,[13] and she trained her nephew Draco Malfoy in Occlumency as part of his mission to kill Albus Dumbledore. This training was effective enough that Draco was able to block out Severus Snape on at least one occasion.[17] It is also likely that Bellatrix could perform Legilimency as well, as she may have penetrated Draco's mind in order to train him to block his thoughts. Apparition: Bellatrix was proficient in Apparition, although her sister Narcissa may be even more skilled than her. This was shown when they both apparated into Spinner's End, with Bellatrix's pop being somewhat louder and Narcissa making only a slight "popping" sound. However, Bellatrix may simply have been too desperate in chasing her sister to do it more quietly.[5] Flying: Bellatrix was a skilful flyer, as she participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters via Broomstick. She fiercely pursued and fiercely duelled with her niece Nymphadora Tonks, who was also proficient in flying. Her ability to duel whilst flying shows her very impressive talent in this field.[3] Teaching skills: Bellatrix taught Draco Occlumency and (non-verbal spells, the Unforgivable Curses and other branches of the Dark Arts) in furtherance of his objective to kill Dumbledore.[17] She also unwittingly taught Harry how to properly use the Unforgivable Curses, given how he acknowledged that his success on the Cruciatus Curse was actually from her taunting.[4] Indomitable willpower: Bellatrix had a very powerful will, remaining adamant in her loyalty to Lord Voldemort even when facing a life sentence in Azkaban. She endured the prison for approximately fourteen years without losing her will to live, in spite of the fact that many prisoners there would have preferred death instead of suffering the depressive states they had been reduced to. She maintained her formidable magical powers and her keen intelligence, although her emotional temperament seemed to have become more unstable due to her years in captivity. Possessions     Bellatrix's first wand   First wand: Her first wand was 12¾" inches long, made of walnut wood, with a dragon heartstring core.[19] Wands with dragon heartstring produce the most flamboyant spells and easily are turned to the Dark Arts.[20] Bellatrix lost her wand during the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, when Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Dobby escaped with it. When Harry shows it to Garrick Ollivander, it was described by him as "unyielding" in nature.[19] Bellatrix purchased her wand from Garrick Ollivander, who was its manufacturer, his wand shop Ollivanders in Diagon Alley. Bellatrix used her wand heavily throughout her life as a Death Eater and throughout the First Wizarding War and Second Wizarding War, using it heavily to perform the Dark Arts. She used it to perform the Cruciatus Curse which tortured both Alice and Frank Longbottom, along with the murder of Sirius Black during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. She lost her wand after the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, after which it was taken by Hermione Granger.[3] Second wand: Bellatrix came into ownership of a second wand after her first wand was stolen by Hermione Granger. She wielded this wand throughout the Battle of Hogwarts, and its length, wand wood and Wand core were all unknown.[3]     Bellatrix's knife   Knife: Bellatrix owned a small, sharp knife which was made of silver. She used her knife to hold Hermione at knifepoint during the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor and later to kill Dobby when he and the others were escaping from Malfoy Manor by throwing it at him, proving herself to be competent in knife fighting.[3] Lestrange Vault: Although this Gringotts vault and its contents were technically owned by her husband's family, Bellatrix was shown to have as much authority of it, and kept many of her own valuable personal items in there.[3] Replica of the Sword of Gryffindor: Bellatrix owned a replica of the Sword of Gryffindor, which was kept in her vault at Gringotts and which she mistakenly believed to be the real sword.[3] Relationships Family  Lord Voldemort: "I'm talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. She just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud." Bellatrix: "She is no niece of ours, my Lord. We — Narcissa and I — have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries." — Voldemort discussing blood purity with fellow Death Eaters[src]  Bellatrix took the pure-blood values of her family very seriously, as indicated by her marriage into a known pure-blood wizarding family and her zealous belief in Death Eater ideology. She had no feelings of affection for those in her family deemed blood traitors by disgracing and dishonouring her family by not fanatically honouring the prejudiced values she did, and readily attacked and killed them on many occasions.  Narcissa Malfoy  Bellatrix: "Draco, move this scum outside. If you haven't got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me." Narcissa: "Don't you dare speak to Draco like –" Bellatrix: "Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious problem!" — Bellatrix arguing with Narcissa in Malfoy Manor[src]      Narcissa Malfoy, her youngest sister   Bellatrix seemed to have had a fairly close and affectionate relationship with her younger sister Narcissa, whom she called "Cissy." Despite distrusting Severus Snape and attempting to dissuade her sister from approaching him, Bellatrix accompanied Narcissa to Spinner's End to request Snape's help in seeing Draco Malfoy through the task assigned to him by Lord Voldemort in 1996. After Snape agreed to make the Unbreakable Vow, Bellatrix acted as the bonding agent, ensuring that Snape would fulfil his promises to Narcissa.[5] Narcissa and Bellatrix occasionally clashed over the former's protectiveness towards her son; She argued that Narcissa should be proud that her son was a Death Eater, while Narcissa consistently demonstrated that the safety of her son and husband were her first priorities.[5] At some point, Bellatrix trained Draco in Occlumency to aid him in his mission.[17]  Delphini Bellatrix had an illegitimate daughter with Lord Voldemort, named Delphini, who was born in secret at Malfoy Manor in the late 1990s.[21] Bellatrix didn't live long enough to watch her daughter grow up; this left the infant Delphi an orphan as her father had been. Euphemia Rowle took Delphi in and raised her, allegedly only because she was offered a substantial amount of gold.[22]  Malfoy family  Bellatrix Lestrange: "That was not my fault! The Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious — if Lucius hadn't —" Narcissa Malfoy: "Don't you dare — don't you dare blame my husband!" — Bellatrix and Narcissa arguing over Lucius' mistakes during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries[src]      Draco Malfoy, her nephew   Bellatrix's relationship with Draco seemed to have some affection; though she seemed to disapprove of his inability to kill and his dislike for torture.[3] She taught him Occlumency, non-verbal spells, and several branches of the Dark Arts, making her already talented nephew a powerful wizard.[17] His blood relationship with her was probably the only reason he was remained alive; due to his father's failure and Snape taking over his 1996-1997 task.      Lucius Malfoy, her brother-in-law   Her brother-in-law Lucius was antagonistic with Bellatrix due to usurping his place within the Death Eater ranks despite the fact she had been imprisoned in Azkaban for fourteen years, unlike Lucius. Their differences in loyalty in the Dark Lord fuelled their antagonism for each other even more.[5] When Bellatrix wanted to murder Harry Potter during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Lucius briefly restrained her.[4] After the battle, she told Narcissa that it was Lucius' fault that she couldn't give Voldemort the Prophecy.[5] However, the two fought together during the skirmish at Malfoy Manor. Seeing Lucius's extreme failure and the confiscation of his wand, Bellatrix treated him with disdain and contempt, showing him little to no respect during their argument of summoning Voldemort for capturing Harry.[3]  Rodolphus Lestrange Bellatrix attended Hogwarts with Rodolphus Lestrange and were part of a gang of other Slytherin students which also included Lucius Malfoy, Evan Rosier, and Severus Snape, all of whom became Death Eaters.[4] She later married him in order to make a "respectable pure-blood marriage",[4] as it was expected of her.[12] There is no indication that their relationship went beyond this. She never expressed any love or concern for him. No children appear beneath their names on the Black family tapestry. It could be surmised that she made no attempts to produce children with her official husband, as she adored her master only and concentrated on pleasing only him. However, Bellatrix and Rodolphus did seem to work effectively together as Death Eaters, suggesting their partnership is strictly professional. Both were some of the most loyal and valued Death Eaters, so it is likely that they would've felt a connection from their mutual devotion to their master. Rodolphus tortured Alice and Frank Longbottom alongside his wife, brother, and Barty Crouch Jnr in 1981.[15] He fought with Bellatrix during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries[4] and the Battle of the Seven Potters. Nymphadora Tonks mentioned cursing him and being pursued by Bellatrix.[3]  Andromeda Tonks and Sirius Black     Sirius Black, a cousin and murder victim    "What did you come after me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!" — Bellatrix taunting Harry after murdering Sirius Black[src]  On the other hand, Bellatrix hated her "blood traitor" relatives. After her sister Andromeda married a muggle-born and was disowned, she never saw her again.[3] Bellatrix shared a mutual loathing with her "dear cousin" Sirius Black, who had a similar temper. The two taunted each other as they duelled during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. After killing Sirius, Bellatrix sadistically jeered at Harry about the death of his godfather on multiple occasions.[4]      Nymphadora Tonks, her niece and murder victim   Nymphadora Tonks  "Bellatrix. She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, she tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I'd got her, I owe Bellatrix." — Tonks explaining Bellatrix's murderous hatred of her[src]  Bellatrix eagerly attacked her niece, Nymphadora Tonks, on at least three occasions. This was likely for a combination of reasons, including Tonks' being a half-blood, an Auror, and member of the Order of the Phoenix, the fact that she had married the werewolf Remus Lupin, and Voldemort's comments to her about "pruning her family tree". Bellatrix eventually murdered Tonks during the Battle of Hogwarts on the 2nd of May 1998.  Regulus Black It is possible that Bellatrix was on good terms with her other cousin, Regulus, who was also a Death Eater during the First Wizarding War. Regulus initially espoused the pure-blood supremacist line associated with his family, and like Bellatrix, was sorted into the Slytherin house during his time at Hogwarts. It is unlikely that he revealed his change of heart to Bellatrix, or anyone else, prior to his death in 1979.  Lord Voldemort  "She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanour; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness." — Bellatrix demonstrates her obsession with Voldemort during the Meeting at Malfoy Manor[src]      Lord Voldemort, her master, with whom she was obsessively in love with   Bellatrix was obsessively in love with Lord Voldemort, which extended to her being (sexually) attracted to him.[12][23][24] More than just being a fanatic, she shared his ideas of blood purity and fascination with the Dark Arts. Unlike many of the other Death Eaters, Bellatrix never attempted to deny her loyalties when her master fell in 1981. Instead, she proudly claimed that she was his most loyal and trusted servant, and stated that he would rise again. She seemed to view Azkaban prison as a mere place to wait for his return.[15] Bellatrix was described as being slavishly devoted to her master, regarding him with "worshipful fascination" and speaking to him in a romantic way.[3] On at least one occasion, during the 1997 meeting of Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor, her cheeks flushed and her eyes welled up with tears when she thought he was praising her. Satisfying him was of the utmost importance to her. She was perfectly willing to kill her niece, Nymphadora Tonks, as a way of "pruning" her "family tree", though she would most likely have done it without his orders, anyway. Bellatrix was outraged by anyone showing her master even the slightest disrespect. When Harry called him by his name in 1996, she became enraged, feeling that he was unworthy of speaking the name. She was also furious when Harry spoke of Voldemort's half-blood status and Muggle father. Despite agreeing with her master's ideology of blood purity, she apparently didn't care that he himself was a half-blood, if she believed this at all. Voldemort might have falsely told his subordinates that he was a pure-blood, something which Harry Potter suspected. If so, she believed her master's lie over the truth from the enemy. Voldemort respected her talents and skills and considered her of greater importance than most of his other servants. At the conclusion of the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, he grabbed her and Apparated away with her. She was the sole Death Eater whom he bothered to help, though this may have been done out of convenience, as she was much closer in proximity than the other captured Death Eaters. However, Voldemort didn't reciprocate her romantic feelings, as he didn't know love. Due to his egotistical and self-centred nature, it is possible that he was at least pleased with her desire for him. Their sexual relationship and the honour of bearing of his child could have also been a reward to Bellatrix for her loyalty to him, as he believed that he had a found a way to cheat death and didn't need to leave an heir behind. When she was killed by Molly Weasley during the final battle, Voldemort's fury was said to "explode like a bomb". Her death was the only one that he attempted to avenge before Harry Potter intervened. It is unlikely, though, that he truly cared about her as a person, rather than being angry about losing someone who was very useful to him.  Severus Snape  Severus Snape: "Well, continue, Bellatrix. Why is it that you do not trust me?" Bellatrix Lestrange: "A hundred reasons! Where to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished?" — Bellatrix questioning Severus Snape's loyalty, showing her distrust of him[src]      Severus Snape, whom she mistrusted   Bellatrix was acquainted with Severus Snape, a fellow Death Eater prior to the end of the First Wizarding War, changing sides shortly before Voldemort's 1981 downfall, and becoming a double agent for Albus Dumbledore. Their relationship prior to Snape's defection is unknown,  Bellatrix was highly suspicious of him due to Severus's alliance with Dumbledore and his spotty record of fervent loyalty to the Dark Lord.[5] Although she was genuine in her mistrust of Snape, she was possibly also envious of the position of trust and respect Snape enjoyed under Voldemort. It is also possible that Snape's half-blood status was a point of derision on Bellatrix's part. In 1996, Bellatrix followed Narcissa to Snape's house, trying to dissuade her from seeking his help in guiding and guarding Draco in the task of killing Albus Dumbledore. She was taken aback by Snape's conformance in making the Unbreakable Vow, for which she acted as a bond-maker.[5] Both she and Snape fought and died at the Battle of Hogwarts. However, Bellatrix's death didn't allow her to discover that her initial mistrust of Snape had been valid after all.[3]  Death Eaters     A Death Eater, her allies   Bellatrix wasn't likely to have viewed many of the other Death Eaters as her equals, as she believed both her skill, devotion, and family status exceed that of others. While it is unclear exactly how much genuine respect the other Death Eaters had for Bellatrix, it was clear they were familiar with her view of herself, as Travers became less suspicious of Hermione Granger, disguised as Bellatrix via Polyjuice Potion in 1998, only after Hermione took on a much haughtier personality. Undoubtedly, she considered Voldemort's most loyal Death Eaters to be those who, like her, were imprisoned in Azkaban at some point: namely, Barty Crouch Jnr, her husband and his brother. While in school Bellatrix was part of a gang that included her husband, Severus Snape, Evan Rosier, Wilkes, Avery, and Mulciber. It's unknown how well she got along with these individuals, both as students and Death Eaters. Rosier was likely related to her on her mother's side. She and Mulciber both were sent to Azkaban at the end of the First Wizarding War and both fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.  Peter Pettigrew seemed pleased to see her as well as Narcissa when they visit him and Snape, though Bellatrix didn't acknowledge him. It's possible that she appreciates Peter for his role in bringing back their master or else dislikes him for not attempting to help him sooner. Bellatrix had a disdainful attitude towards the Snatchers. Despite their role in capturing Harry, she treated them like lowly servants and was quick to attack them the moment one of them disobeyed her. Fenrir Greyback showed fear and resentment towards her, though Bellatrix did acknowledge his role in capturing Harry and agreed that he did deserve to be rewarded.  Kreacher     Kreacher, her family's house-elf   Kreacher was the last house-elf of the House of Black, who shared his family's pure-blood supremacist values. Like Walburga Black, he was disappointed with Sirius for not sharing those same values, thus favouring the latter's cousins, Bellatrix and Narcissa. He kept pictures of Bellatrix and some other Black family members in his sleeping area at 12 Grimmauld Place. Bellatrix's picture was his favourite, as he had attempted to repair it with Spellotape and placed it in front of the others.  In December of 1995, when Sirius yelled at Kreacher to "get out" of a room, Kreacher interpreted the words as a command to leave his master's service and exit the house altogether. Because Bellatrix was currently in Azkaban and Andromeda had been disowned, Narcissa was the next family member whom he could serve. He went to her home and gave her information about Harry's godson relationship with Sirius. After Bellatrix escaped from Azkaban, he helped her by injuring Buckbeak, Sirius's hippogriff. He even lied to Harry about Sirius being gone from the house one day, when he had actually only gone upstairs to tend to Buckbeak's injury. Harry went to the Ministry of Magic to "save" Sirius, who in turn went there to save Harry. After she killed Sirius in a duel,[4] Kreacher hoped to officially move into her possession, but Sirius's will transferred ownership to Harry.[25] Kreacher eventually gave his loyalty to Harry in 1997, fighting against Voldemort and his Death Eaters, Bellatrix included, during the Battle of Hogwarts.[3]  Harry Potter  "You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!" — Bellatrix taunting Harry Potter[src]      Harry Potter, a hated enemy   Bellatrix Lestrange saw Harry Potter as her master's most hated enemy and despised him for the inexplicable threat he posed to the Dark Lord, wanting him dead very badly. She thought of him as someone lesser than herself, due to his status as a half-blood and for having less experience than her. Harry had hated Bellatrix ever since he first saw her in the Pensieve due to learning that she was responsible for the attack on Alice and Frank Longbottom. He seemed to have an odd fascination with her prorably caused by his loathing of her. Harry was immediately drawn to her picture when the news of the ten escaped Death Eaters appeared in the Daily Prophet and experienced "a little jolt in his stomach" after seeing her picture in Kreacher's bedroom. After she murdered his godfather in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Harry aggressively pursued Bellatrix after she fled from Dumbledore and attempted to cast the Cruciartus Curse on her. He also taunted her for her failed efforts in achieving the prophecy for Voldemort. At the onset of the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, the mere sound of her voice when she appeared in the fray was enough to make his fear reach a new high. Bellatrix killed his close friends, Dobby the house-elf and Nymphadora Tonks. When she attempted to murder Ginny Weasley (the girl he loved) during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry was diverted from his goal of destroying Voldemort in the hopes of attacking her. He was stopped only by the sudden intervention of Molly Weasley.  Longbottom family  Bellatrix: "Longbottom? Why I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy...." Neville Longbottom: " I DOE YOU HAB!" — Bellatrix cruelly mocking Neville about his parents[src]      Frank and Alice Longbottom. whom she helped torture into insanity   After the fall of the Dark Lord in 1981, Bellatrix along with three her husband Rodolphus, the latter's brother, Rabastan and Bartemius Crouch Junior set out to attack members of the Order of the Phoenix, hoping to interrogate them for information on Voldemort's whereabouts. She personally attacked Alice and Frank Longbottom, torturing them by means of the Cruciatus Curse in her attempt at forcing them to yield the information she wanted. The event rendered the Aurors clinically and permanently insane, therefore condemning them to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for the remainder of their lives.      Bellatrix threatens Neville Longbottom during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries   Prior to the Longbottoms' capture and torture, Alice had given birth to a baby boy, Neville Longbottom. He was left with parents incapable of even recognising him let alone caring for him, and so he was raised by his grandmother. Bellatrix seemed to find the fact that she had caused Neville's family tragedy highly amusing. Upon realising who Neville was, she proceeded to mock his loss, extremely angering him in the process.  Ever since he was old enough to understand why his parents needed to be hospitalised, Neville had despised Bellatrix Lestrange, but given his benign nature, he never sought vengeance against her. Instead, he honoured his parents by showing more bravery than anyone could have expected of him, eventually retaliating when Bellatrix taunted him, rebelling against the tyranny of the Carrows during his seventh year at Hogwarts, and subsequently fighting during the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts against Voldemort's forces.  Albus Dumbledore  " [...] or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it [...] " — Albus Dumbledore regarding Bellatrix's sadistic tendencies[src]     Albus Dumbledore, a hated enemy   Albus Dumbledore knew Bellatrix to be a highly dangerous Death Eater since the First Wizarding War, having witnessed her trial and imprisonment after she tortured Aurors to insanity and beyond. Dumbledore seemed to understand her very well; he admitted to Severus Snape that he would prefer to not fall prey to Bellatrix Lestrange in his weakened state (caused by Voldemort's cursed Horcrux ring), as she liked to "play with her food before she eats it"; in other words, inflict unbelievable pain before finally delivering the killing blow.[3] Though Bellatrix was fanatically loyal to Voldemort and believed that he was greater and more powerful than Dumbledore, she would not brave Dumbledore in a duel, as she recognised him as a far more superior wizard than she was a witch. During the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Bellatrix opted to flee rather than engage Dumbledore in battle, being the only Death Eater in the Death Chamber who succeeded in escaping from him.[4] It is possible that Dumbledore knew Bellatrix while she was a student, either being her headmaster or teacher. It's unknown what kind of relationship, if any, the two had at the time.  Hermione Granger  "Drop your wands. Drop them, or we'll see exactly how filthy her blood is!" — Bellatrix threatening to cut Hermione's throat[src]      Hermione Granger, a hated enemy   Bellatrix tortured Hermione when the trio were caught by Snatchers. She despised her for being Muggle-born and selected her to be tortured in order to get the truth out of her as to why the trio had Godric Gryffindor's sword. She thought the group had stole it from her vault, but even through this pressure, Hermione lied that it was a fake and Griphook helped get that across. However, the older witch doubted this statement. Along with her friends, Hermione managed to escape, but her friend Dobby died at Bellatrix's hands.[3] In the Battle of Hogwarts, Bellatrix duelled Hermione, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood all at once and proved equal in talent to them together, although Hermione duelled using Bellatrix's own wand. All these events greatly implied that Hermione was viewed as hated, persistent, lowly dirt by Bellatrix.[3]  Order of the Phoenix and enemies  Ron Weasley: "No! You can have me, keep me!" Bellatrix Lestrange: "If she dies under questioning, I'll take you next. Blood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book." — Bellatrix's prejudice and belief in blood supremacy[src]      The Order of the Phoenix, her enemies   Most of the Order of the Phoenix knew Bellatrix as one of the most dangerous and sadistic of Lord Voldemort's followers, especially considering Bellatrix managed to kill, seriously injure, or duel and successfully defeat several Order members.[4] She bested Kingsley Shacklebolt at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries,[4] was disgusted by Remus Lupin, as a werewolf, marrying into her family through Nymphadora Tonks, and offered to take Ron Weasley — a member of the Weasley family, well known in pure-blood supremacist circles as "blood traitors" — next in her painful interrogation in events in the Malfoy manor. She also found Minerva McGonagall's despair at seeing Harry Potter's seemingly dead body amusing.[3]      Molly Weasley, the witch who defeated and killed her   During the Battle of Hogwarts, Bellatrix cruelly taunted Molly Weasley about the death of Molly's son, Fred. When she tried to attack Molly's daughter, Ginny, she instigated a vicious battle between Molly and herself. This battle ended in the death of Bellatrix, who continued laughing derisively at the efforts of her opponent until the moment she realised Molly had defeated her.[3]  Media Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Bellatrix escapes from Azkaban (HD)Azkaban BreakoutHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Bellatrix reveals herself to Harry and the others (HD)Harry Meets Bellatrix LestrangeHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 - the Death Eaters at Malfoy Manor part 1 (HD)Meeting at Malfoy ManorHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 - Bellatrix's reign of terror at Malfoy Manor (part 1)Bellatrix's Reign of Terror (part 1)Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 - Bellatrix's reign of terror at Malfoy Manor (part 2)Bellatrix's Reign of Terror (part 2)Hermione being Tortured by Bellatrix in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1Torturing HermioneMolly Weasley vs Bellatrix LestrangeBellatrix's Final Duel Etymology Like many members of the House of Black, Bellatrix's name is derived from that of a star. Bellatrix is the third brightest star in the constellation Orion. It is also known as the Amazon Star, which is one of Orion's seven brightest stars. In fact, it's the twenty-seventh brightest star in the night sky. The Amazons were warrior women in Greek mythology, which is presumably an allusion to Bellatrix being among the most dangerously skilled Death Eaters. Her name likely has Latin, French and English origins: Bella is Latin both for the plural of bellum, meaning war, and the feminine singular adjective meaning "beautiful;" trix is Latin feminine suffix (i.e. Bellatrix is the Latin word for a female warrior or a personification of feminine beauty). 'Bellatrix' also translates directly to 'war-like'. Lestrange is likely a play on l'étrange, which is French meaning "the strange one". Her name thus alludes to her own mental instability, although technically Lestrange came from Bellatrix's husband Rodolphus.  Behind the scenes     Bellatrix as she appears on  Pottermore   Originally, Helen McCrory was going to play the role of Bellatrix in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, but due to her pregnancy, she opted out of the film and was replaced by Helena Bonham Carter. Ironically, Bonham Carter herself learned she was pregnant shortly after completing filming. McCrory was eventually cast as Bellatrix's sister Narcissa in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. In the film, Bonham Carter is noticeably wearing looser clothing, as opposed to her form-fitting costume of the previous film. With Bonham Carter's casting, she is roughly the same age as Bellatrix during the books (early-mid 40s), but she is younger than all of the Marauders, whom she pre-dates in her Hogwarts education. On the tapestry depicted in the film, the face of Bellatrix pictured is a face of Helena Bonham Carter. On the DVD there is a different picture of Bellatrix on the tapestry, where she has a purple hat and looks stylistically similar to her sisters. In an interview, Helena Bonham Carter mentions that the scene where she holds Neville with her wand to his throat contains an injury. She ad-libbed pushing her wand into his ear canal, thinking it was good torture. Unfortunately Matthew Lewis moved his head towards her and ruptured his ear drum. She didn't learn until later that she did it, and regrets it because Matthew Lewis "Is such a nice young man." In the films, her Apparition (or technically flight) manifests as plumes of black smoke. Her wanted poster is featured on an official Warner Brothers Harry Potter t-shirt, which says that Bellatrix was convicted for murder. In the book, she was sentenced to Azkaban for her participation in the torture of Frank and Alice Longbottom, though it is likely that she also committed several murders as well. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry witnesses her trial for the torture of Neville's parents in the pensieve. Despite this, she does not appear in the film adaptation, in which Barty Crouch Junior seems to be solely responsible for the crime, although Bellatrix's role in it is later revealed in the following film.    Bellatrix's Death Eater Mask   In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Bonham Carter's costume reflected the mental state of the character, thus the torn gloves and dress. She also had alternate attires with a hood worn up and a mask, but they were not used in the final cut of the film. In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Bellatrix participates in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower but in the book there is no mention of her. A new scene was added of The Burrow being attacked and burned over the Christmas holidays by Bellatrix, Fenrir Greyback and an unknown Death Eater, possibly Amycus Carrow, Corban Yaxley, or Thorfinn Rowle. The script for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince describes Bellatrix as a "mad child." In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Bellatrix does not question Snape about his loyalties nor does she show any signs of disagreement or hatred towards Snape. However, she does sneer at him and taunt him for being a coward as well as tell her sister that "He can't be trusted" to which Narcissa responds "The Dark Lord trusts him". Speaking to Entertainment Weekly in 2007, Helena Bonham Carter said of Bellatrix "She's very sick. She's got problems. I think she's been in prison a bit too long. But I suspect even before prison she had problems. She's a racist, obsessed with blood purity. And she's in love with Voldemort, really."[26]     Bellatrix escapes from the Ministry of Magic via Floo Powder, as shown in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix   In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Bellatrix appears in the adapted scene of the Battle of the Astronomy Tower despite there being no mention of her presence there in the sixth book. There is no literal "Battle" between the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix during this scene; allowing the former group to pass through Hogwarts without resistance and Bellatrix to walk insanely on the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall before casting a spell to destroy all of the Hall's many windows. It is during the segment in the Astronomy Tower that she speaks the line, "well done", to Draco for cornering Dumbledore (In the book, it is Amycus Carrow who congratulates Draco for his work, and far less formally) Bellatrix then proceeds to order Draco to hurry and murder Dumbledore in place of Yaxley. Also different in this section of the film is that Bellatrix casts the Dark Mark into the sky after Dumbledore's death, though it was Gibbon who did so prior to the death of the Headmaster in the book. Finally, Bellatrix (in the film) is shown to commit acts that were Thorfinn Rowle's doing in the book, including burning down Hagrid's Hut in an explosive way and briefly torturing Harry with the Cruciatus Curse.     A Portrait of Bellatrix Lestrange, as seen on Harry Potter: Wizards Unite   In the special features of the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, J.K Rowling describes Bellatrix as 'the female Death Eater par excellence'. Carter described the character as being "as bonkers as they come", commenting that Bellatrix has "a bit of a child-like madness... like boys who like to pick apart an insect for the sake of it".[27] Sirius Black told Harry Potter that she ran in the same crowd as Severus Snape while at Hogwarts, but her date of birth makes this impossible. Bellatrix would have attended Hogwarts from 1962 to 1969, or possibly 1963 to 1970, depending on which month in 1951 she was born in, whereas Snape began his schooling in 1971. This may simply be an error, as J. K. Rowling has admitted that maths is not her strong suit.[28] Another possible explanation could be that both Bellatrix and Snape went around with the same type of people, some of whom may have overlapped depending on age. It is is also possible that she failed her exams and had to repeat several Hogwarts years, though this is extremely unlikely as she was rather active during the First Wizarding War. She may have been a classmate of Rita Skeeter, as both women were born in the same year (1951). It is also likely that she knew Arthur Weasley and Molly Prewett closely, the latter being a year ahead of Bella (1950), and most likely had a bad relationship with them, given their ideas in favour of equality between wizards, regardless of blood status, Muggles and rejection of the blood supremacist philosophy. Bellatrix is notable for being one of the few female Death Eaters.     Bellatrix in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7   She is normally pictured on the right of Lord Voldemort, and most people on the right side of leaders, are thought as the most loyal follower of the leader. She has the distinction of being the only person in the series to duel all three main characters on separate occasions. She attacked Harry Potter during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, fought Ron Weasley in the sky during the Battle of the Seven Potters, and duelled with Hermione Granger in the Battle of Hogwarts. J. K. Rowling states in an interview that she had always intended that Molly Weasley would kill Bellatrix, for two main reasons: Firstly, so that Molly could "have her moment [of victory]" and show the doubting Bellatrix that simply because she dedicates herself to her family doesn't mean that she isn't a powerful witch. And second, to show the difference of Molly's romantic and maternal love against Bellatrix's obsessive love of Voldemort.[24] She is the only Black sister to have a child born out of wedlock.     Bellatrix as a LEGO minifigure   It is likely that it was Bellatrix who picked the name for her daughter from Lord Voldemort, as Delphini follows the tradition of the House of Black to name its members after stars and celestial bodies. It's also likely that if it was indeed Bellatrix's choice, Voldemort could have approved it as it was a pure-blood name which complied with traditions of high-born pure-blood noble family. In ways, Bellatrix was like Minerva McGonagall; both were very powerful witches who were unfailingly devoted to their cause and their leader's greatest deputy. However, McGonagall (like most on her side) only trusted Snape because Dumbledore did, whereas Bellatrix never trusted Snape despite her master doing so. In the final book and film, Molly Weasley is the one who kills Bellatrix. However, in the final video game, after Neville defies Voldemort and pulls the sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat, Voldemort casts a Killing Curse at Neville and it ricochets off of the sword and hits Bellatrix, she does not die when it hits her, but screams when it does. She later fights Molly and is defeated, lying on the floor dead, unlike the film, when she is blasted into ash.     Bellatrix as a POP! Vinyl   For the release of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Popco had introduced several "series" of Harry Potter film action figures, including Bellatrix, in the United Kingdom and several other European countries. This made people in the United States go online to buy this action figure and/or others via British departments of certain online shopping websites. These websites include Amazon UK and Ebay UK. Bellatrix appears as something of a mini-boss in the Harry Potter Adventure World of LEGO Dimensions. She can be fought if the player knocks on the door to Grimmauld Place, then after battling five to fifteen Death Eaters she must be hit three times with an object using the levitation charm.    Bellatrix Lestrange (as an Azkaban convict) as a POP! Vinyl   In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, Bellatrix kills Dobby by launching various objects at him (like a fish or a lamp) which causes his death by crushing him instead of throwing her knife. Also, her death is very different. After fighting Molly Weasley and Kingsley Shacklebolt, Bellatrix's LEGO body separates in three pieces (her head, her torso, and her legs) and later explodes in a burst of purple light, killing her in the process. Helena Bonham Carter, Bellatrix's actress, previously worked with Ralph Fiennes, Voldemort's actor, in Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, portraying Lady Campanula Tottington and Lord Victor Quartermaine, respectively. Ironically, given Bellatrix and Voldemort's relationship, Tottington had the exact opposite feelings to Quartermaine. Much like for Voldemort, two different versions of Bellatrix's death were shot as director David Yates was unsure whether or not to use effects for the 3D element being presented in the film. To help him make his decision, he shot a take of her collapsing to her death, while the other take would be shot differently to allow the effects team to break Bellatrix into many pieces. The latter would make it into the final film. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 364 images related to Bellatrix Lestrange.
