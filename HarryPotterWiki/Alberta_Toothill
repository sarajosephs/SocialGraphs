Famously overcame the favorite, Samson Wiblin, with a Blasting Curse." — Chocolate Frog Card[src]  Alberta Toothill (1391—1483) was a English medieval witch and duellist who, defying all odds, won the All-England Wizarding Duelling Competition of 1430.[1]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Early life 1.2 Adulthood 1.3 Post-mortem   2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Early life Alberta was born in 1391, somewhere in England. If she enrolled at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she attended the school from around 1402 to 1409, under Headmistress Phyllida Spore.  Adulthood    Alberta Toothill cheering after winning the All-England Wizarding Duelling Competition   In 1430, aged thirty-eight or thirty-nine, Toothill took part in the All-England Wizarding Duelling Competition. She made it to the finals, and proved to be an effective duellist when she, against all odds, defeated the expected winner, Samson Wiblin, with a Blasting Curse.[1] Alberta Toothill died in 1483, aged around ninety-two.[1]  Post-mortem By the 1990s, Toothill was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card for her skill in duelling, which pictured her cheering and holding the All-England Wizarding Duelling trophy after her defeat of Samson Wiblin.[1] Sometime in the 2010s, a member of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force discovered a long-lost memory phial belonging to Alberta Toothill, featuring her 1430 duelling victory. The historical discovery brought new techniques to light — studying the duel came in handy to contain the threat of the Calamity.[2]  Magical abilities and skills Duelling: Toothill was an incredibly accomplished and proficient duellist, having been the winner of the All-England Wizarding Duelling Competition in 1430, defeating numerous skilled opponents during the tournament. She was also a mistress of martial magic, having successfully cast a particularly powerful and destructive Blasting Curse which defeated her opponent with much force. For her outstanding achievement in the sport of duelling, she was immortalised on a silver Chocolate Frog Card.[1] Etymology The name Alberta is the feminine form of German name Alberta which means noble and intelligent.
