The History of Magic exam featured him.[3] He was also immortalised on a silver Chocolate Frog Card, as part of the Famous Witches and Wizards Cards series.[2]  Behind the scenes It is weird that Gaspard Shingleton's achievements are covered so prominently in the 1992 History of Magic first year exam, when it is revealed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that "Professor Bagshot doesn't cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century"[4] in her work, which is used as the textbook for the subject. Similarly, the inventor of the Self-Stirring Cauldron is described as a "batty old wizard" in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, yet he would only be in his early thirties at the time. If he attended Hogwarts, Shingleton might have been in the same year as the Marauders, Lily Evans, and Severus Snape. If he was not, he was in the year ahead of them.
