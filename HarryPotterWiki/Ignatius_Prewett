Ignatius and his wife Lucretia did not have any children of their own.  Given that Molly gave her third son Percy the middle name "Ignatius", presumably in honour of her uncle, it is likely that she and Ignatius were close.  Behind the scenes Ignatius is a Roman name altered from its original Etruscan to resemble the Latin ignis, "fire". It was the name of several saints, including the founder of the Jesuits.[4] Given that Lucretia Black from the Black Family was not disowned and burnt off the Black Family Tree, implies that her marriage to Ignatius Prewett was a "respectable" pure-blood marriage. Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Appears on Black family tapestry) Notes and references   ↑ If Ignatius were not a pure-blood, then Lucretia would have been disowned from the Black Family for marrying him; she was not.  ↑ Black Family tree  ↑ Sirius Black stated in Ch. 6 of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that Molly Weasley was his "cousin by marriage". This means that Ignatius could not have been Molly, Fabian, and Gideon's father, as this would have made them first cousins by blood of Sirius [false logic: this merely means that Lucretia Black Prewett (Ignatius' wife) could not have been their mother]. Ignatius was Sirius's uncle by marriage, and if Molly was his niece, this could explain Sirius's comment.
