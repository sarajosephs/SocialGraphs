Tiberius worked at the Ministry of Magic, and according to Draco Malfoy, was highly influential there. He was close with the Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, and would often go hunting Nogtails with him and Bertie Higgs. When he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he was a member of Horace Slughorn's Slug Club.[2]  Etymology The name "Tiberius" is a Roman praenomen, or given name, meaning "of the Tiber" in Latin. The Tiber is the river that runs through Rome. Tiberius was the second Roman emperor, the stepson of emperor Augustus. He was a paranoid and sadistic emperor who ordered mass arrests whilst spending most of his time in his palace on the Isle of Capri, engaging in all manners of sexual immorality.  Appearances Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (First mentioned) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Slughorn resigned from his teaching position in 1981, meaning Tiberius would have been a member of the Slug Club by at least then.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 7 (The Slug Club)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1              Categories         Categories:   20th century births    British individuals    Males    McLaggen family    Ministry of Magic employees    Slug Club    Unknown House    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
