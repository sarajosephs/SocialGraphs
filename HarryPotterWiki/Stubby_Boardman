The man people believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Boardman, lead singer of the popular singing group The Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being struck in the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Norton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago. I recognised him the moment I saw his picture in the paper. Now, Stubby couldn’t possibly have committed those crimes, because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me. I have written to the Minister of Magic and am expecting him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any day now." — Doris Purkiss, The Quibbler[src]  Stubby Boardman was the lead singer of a musical group called The Hobgoblins.[1]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography It was said by The Quibbler in 1980 that he retired after having a turnip thrown at his ear during a concert at the Little Norton Church Hall. He and Doris Purkiss were also said to be in a relationship.[1] It was said by The Quibbler in 1995 that he was in fact Sirius Black in disguise, based on the word of Purkiss, who claimed that she was having a romantic dinner with him on the night he supposedly murdered Peter Pettigrew and twelve Muggles.[1] In 1996, The Quibbler claimed this person was Mina Lima in disguise.[3] Both claims were false.  Etymology A boardman is a man who perambulates the streets carrying an advertising-board; a sandwich-man.

It would seem unlikely that he had lighter hair, but this is unproven.  ↑ Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) (see this image and this image)                Categories         Categories:   Conspiracy theories    Males    Musicians    Plot to murder Peter Pettigrew    The Quibbler             Languages      Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
