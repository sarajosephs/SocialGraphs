Newt Scamander: "What's he doing here?" Grimmson: "Taking on the job you're too soft to do." — Grimmson insulting Newton Scamander[src]  Gunnar[4] Grimmson (fl. 1927) was a Dark Wizard that worked as a bounty hunter in the 1920s, who was also a follower of Gellert Grindelwald.[5]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Personality and traits 3 Magical abilities and skills 4 Etymology 5 Behind the scenes 6 Appearances 7 Notes and references   Biography  "Well, gentlemen. I assume this means I have the job." — Grimmson after being hired to hunt Credence[src]  In 1927, Gunnar hid in the corner of a hearing room and came out after Newton Scamander refused to assist the British Ministry of Magic to hunt down and kill Credence Barebone.[1] He was hired following Scamander's departure from the meeting.[6] Newt and Gunnar most likely had a negative history with each other, given their very acrimonious exchange in the Ministry.[1]   Grimmson: "She's dead." Grindelwald: "How did the boy take it?" Grimmson: "He's sensitive. The Ministry won't be happy when I tell them I've missed. They know my reputation." Grindelwald: "Listen to me. The disapproval of cowards is praise to the brave. Your name will be written in glory when wizards rule the world. And the clock is ticking faster. You keep watch over Credence. Keep him safe. For the greater good." Grimmson: "For the greater good." — Grimmson and Grindewald talking in Paris[src]     Grimmson speaking to Grindelwald in Paris   Grimmson was hired to travel to Paris in order to kill Credence Barebone.[6] Grimmson also, however, secretly received instructions from Gellert Grindelwald to kill Irma Dugard, to deprive Credence of the answers he was seeking and to push him into Grindelwald's arms.[3] Grimmson accomplished his task during a swift attack. Credence attempted to stop and slay Grimmson in revenge, but the latter was able to maintain a particularly strong protective Shield Charm to protect himself from Credence's Obscurial form long enough to Disapparate and escape.[2] After the killing, he talked with Grindelwald beneath a bridge over the Seine, where he informed him that Dugard was dead, but that he had failed to capture Credence, to his disappointment. Grindelwald assured him that his "name would be written in glory when wizards rule the world", and for him to continue keeping watch over him.[3]  Personality and traits Due to his status as a bounty hunter for the British Ministry of Magic, Gunnar Grimmson was a rather sinister and ruthless individual, with a vocal and mutual dislike of Newt Scamander,[1] and seemingly only being loyal to Gellert Grindelwald.[3] Indeed, Grimmson was the polar opposite of Newt Scamander - Newt was a kindly caretaker of beasts, while Grimmson was a vicious beast hunter.[1] He was also a cold-blooded and merciless killer, as he coldly and swiftly murdered Irma Dugard with the Killing Curse[2] in order to fulfil Grindelwald's wishes.[3]  Magical abilities and skills Bounty hunter skills: Gunnar Grimmson was a skilled bounty hunter, since the British Ministry of Magic trusted him with the important mission of tracking down and killing the extremely dangerous Obscurial Credence Barebone,[1] while Gellert Grindelwald trusted Grimmson to kill Irma Dugard.[3] He was shown to be a skilled wizard, given how he entered Irma Dugard's residence and moved seemlessly through a wall as it bent around his body, subtly causing objects around the wall to move as if disturbed by wind. He also was able to trap Nagini partially inside the wall after dragging her into it, leaving her with seemingly no way to escape even as she shifted between her human and Maledictus form until Credence destroyed the wall she was stuck in.[2]    Grimmson ruthlessly and swiftly killing Irma Durgard with the Killing Curse   Dark Arts: Grimmson was shown to be proficient in the Dark Arts, swiftly casting the Killing Curse nonverbally which killed Irma Dugard.[2] Charms: Grimmson seemed to be skilled with charms, as he was able to cast and maintain an extremely powerful Shield Charm, enough to block the devastating attacks of Credence's Obscurus long enough to Disapparate away to safety.[2] Nonverbal magic: Grimmson was able to nonverbally use the Killing Curse on Irma Dugard in Paris, France. Apparition: Grimmson, like most adult wizards, was capable of Apparating at will, though he seemed more skilled than most, managing to Disapparate from Credence without relinquishing his Shield Charm until the very moment he was gone, without losing concentration.[2] Etymology Gunnar is a name of Nordic origin (Gunnarr in Old Norse), meaning  fighter, soldier, and attacker, and stem from an old Viking saying which means "brave and bold warrior". (Gunnr "war" and arr "warrior"). Grimmson is a patronymic name of Icelandic origin meaning "son of Grímur", ultimately meaning "fierce", "to thunder", or (in the context of an alternate name for Odin), "mask". Behind the scenes Grimmson was played by Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.[5] Based on his name and the nationality of his actor, Grimmson may have been born in Iceland or been of Icelandic descent.
