Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader." — Description of Dudley Dursley's gang[src]  Dennis (born c. 1980) was a Muggle and, in his youth, a member of Dudley Dursley's gang. Dennis, along with the rest of the group, was described as "big and stupid". During the summer months of 1991, Dennis would go to Dudley's house every day, along with his friends Piers Polkiss, Malcolm and Gordon. This forced Harry Potter to spend as much time as possible out of the house, as they were fond of bullying him.[1]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology The name "Dennis" comes from Denys or Denis, the medieval French forms of Dionysius. Saint Denis was a 3rd-century missionary to Gaul who was beheaded in Paris. He is credited with converting the Gauls to Christianity and is considered the patron saint of France.  Behind the scenes    Dennis as a LEGO minifigure   Dennis was played by Christopher Rithin in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, but his role was uncredited. In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 he does not join his friends in teasing Harry because he became too dizzy after riding on the roundabout.
