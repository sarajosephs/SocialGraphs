The password required to gain access to said shortcut was "Cheese Charmer".[2]  Contents  1 Behind the scenes 2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Behind the scenes An author named Gerda Curd is credited with having produced a revised edition of Charm Your Own Cheese.[3] It is possible that "Gerda Curd" is simply Catchlove's pen name. If she attended Hogwarts, Catchlove might have been in the same year as the Marauders, Lily Evans, and Severus Snape. If she was not, she was in the year behind them. Etymology "Greta" is a short form of Margareta. A famous bearer of this name was Swedish actress Greta Garbo (1905-1990).  Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 3 images related to Greta Catchlove.
