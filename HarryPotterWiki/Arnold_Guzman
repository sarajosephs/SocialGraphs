The wizarding and non-wizarding worlds have been at peace for over a century. Grindelwald wants to see that peace destroyed and for certain members of our community his message is very seductive. Many purebloods believe it is their birthright to rule not only our world but the non-magic world as well." — Arnold Guzman's concerns about Gellert Grindelwald[src]  Arnold Guzman was an American wizard who was the American Emissary to the International Confederation of Wizards in 1927.  Contents  1 Biography 2 Personality and traits 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography In 1927, Guzman attended a hearing at the British Ministry of Magic, being a part of a committee comprised of himself, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Torquil Travers, and Rudolph Spielman of the International Confederation Wizards. The subject of the hearing was the appeal of Newt Scamander's international travel ban. Scamander's appeal was ultimately denied by Guzman and the other committee members.[2]  Personality and traits Arnold was a calm, but prim and very determined person, fearing the Global wizarding war that Gellert Grindelwald had begun, as Arnold valued peace and diplomacy.  Behind the scenes Guzman is played by Cornell John in the second instalment of the Fantastic Beasts film series.[3] Appearances Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay (First appearance) Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald Notes and references   ↑ "“Crimes of Grindelwald” Set Visit: Inside the Prop Department with Pierre Bohanna  ↑ Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay, Scene 19  ↑ name=IMDB>Full Credits at IMDB     International Confederation of Wizards      International Confederation of Wizards' Conference   Supreme Mugwump   Pierre Bonaccord · Cottismore Croyne · Sidley Smirk Platter · Anton Vogel · Vicência Santos · Albus Dumbledore · Babajide Akingbade   Delegates   Momolu Wotorson · Ya Zhou · Heinrich Eberstadt (Switzerland) · Albus Dumbledore (Great Britain)   Other employees   Hector Podmore (Great Britain) · Rudolph Spielman · Arnold Guzman (USA) · Ida Webb (Great Britain) · Royston Idlewind · Mentor Metaxas · Constance Pickering (Great Britain) · Mathilda Grimblehawk (Great Britain)   Divisions and posts   Calamity World Centre · Department of Aurors · Educational Office · Head of Incarceration · High Council · Quidditch Committee · International Director · International Task Force · Security Advisor · Statute of Secrecy Task Force   Possessions   Incarceration Carriage   Events   Candidates' Dinner · Selection Ceremony · The walk of the Qilin  This article or section is a stub.
