I saw him, Mr Fudge, I swear, it was You-Know Who, he grabbed a woman and Disapparated!" — Williamson upon seeing Lord Voldemort[src]  Williamson was a British wizard who worked as an Auror for the British Ministry of Magic. He was described as wearing scarlet red robes and a long pony tail when Harry Potter first met him.[1]  Biography He was the first Auror to see Lord Voldemort just before he fled the Ministry of Magic in 1996 after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Fudge then sent him and John Dawlish to deal with the captured Death Eaters.[1]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 36 (The Only One He Ever Feared)     Department of Magical Law Enforcement employees      Heads of Department   Justus Pilliwickle · Torquil Travers · Bartemius Crouch Senior · Amelia Bones · Pius Thicknesse · Corban Yaxley · Arthur Weasley · Harry Potter   Auror Office   Heads: Theseus Scamander · Rufus Scrimgeour · Gawain Robards · Harry Potter    Mordecai Berrycloth · John Dawlish · Penelope Fawley · Dorian Fungbury · Timothy Hale · Alice Longbottom · Frank Longbottom · Neville Longbottom · Alastor Moody · Riya Patel · Proudfoot · Savage · Kingsley Shacklebolt · Nymphadora Tonks · Ronald Weasley · Williamson · Unidentified Aurors · Unidentified male Auror at Hogwarts · Four Unidentified Aurors at Hogwarts · Director of the Investigation Department No. 61042   Improper Use of Magic Office   Heads: Travers · Dolores Umbridge    Mafalda Hopkirk · Honoria's fiancé · Mafalda Hopkirk's Ministerial Superior · Rufus Fudge · Orabella Nuttley · Chester Davies · Linderina Crane   Other personnel   Leta Lestrange · Minerva McGonagall · Elphinstone Urquart · Alastor Gumboil · Arnold Peasegood · Arthur Weasley · Perkins · Cerberus Langarm · Hermione Granger · Bob Ogden · Tulip Karasu's mother · Tulip Karasu's father · Dempster Wiggleswade · Amelia Bones's assistant · Arthur Weasley's ten subordinates · Unidentified Hit Wizard · Unidentified Wizengamot clerk             Categories         Categories:   Auror Office personnel    Aurors    British individuals    Males    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Português do Brasil Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
