Yes, Merlin himself, the most famous wizard in history! He learned all he knew in this very house! Do you want to follow in the footsteps of Merlin? Or would you rather sit at the old desk of that illustrious ex-Hufflepuff, Eglantine Puffett, inventor of the Self-Soaping Dishcloth? I didn’t think so." — Gemma Farley.[src]  Eglantine Puffett was the inventor of the Self-Soaping Dishcloth.[3] During her childhood, she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and was Sorted into the Hufflepuff house.[3] Gemma Farley, a Slytherin Prefect at Hogwarts in the 1990s, downplayed Eglantine's personal achievement when welcoming first-year students recently sorted into her own House, asking them if they would rather "follow in the footsteps of Merlin" (a former Slytherin) or "sit at the old desk of that illustrious ex-Hufflepuff, Eglantine Puffett, inventor of the Self-Soaping Dishcloth?"[3]  Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ She had already left Hogwarts in 1991, implying she was most likely at least 17.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6  Pottermore introduction for Slytherins (transcription available here)              Categories         Categories:   British or Irish individuals    Females    Hufflepuffs    Inventors    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
