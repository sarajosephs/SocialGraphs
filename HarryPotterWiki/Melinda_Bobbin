Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries —" — Horace Slughorn mentioning Bobbin to Harry Potter[src]  Melinda Bobbin was a witch who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1990s. Horace Slughorn described her as "charming" and made her a member of the Slug Club in 1996. Her family owned a large chain of apothecaries.[4]  Etymology A "bobbin" is a spool or reel that holds thread or yarn for spinning, weaving, knitting, sewing, or making lace.
