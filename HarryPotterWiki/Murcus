Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake, and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions, as follows...." — Albus Dumbledore announcing the results of the Second Task[src]  Merchieftainess Murcus was a Selkie and the leader of the Merpeople who lived in the lake in the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[1]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Physical appearance 3 Personality and traits 4 Behind the scenes 5 Appearances 6 Notes and references   Biography Murcus was, presumably, born and raised in the Black Lake in Scotland, and at some point in time was pronounced Merchieftainess of the Black Lake selkie colony.[1] She witnessed the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, watching carefully as each of the four champions struggled to achieve their task.[1] Thereafter, she relayed the events at the bottom of the lake to Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, who could speak and understand Mermish and who was responsible for overseeing the task.[1] In June of 1997, she and her tribe attended the funeral of Albus Dumbledore, where they sung for him, a tune that despite being very chilling was clearly a lament of sorrow.[2] It was evident to the onlookers present that she and her colony, at least, were sad to see him go.[2]  Physical appearance Murcus, like the rest of her tribe, had long, wild, dark-green hair and brilliant yellow eyes that matched her teeth.[1] She was wilder and more ferocious than any of the others.[1]  Personality and traits Despite her lethal and ferocious looks, she appeared to be quite caring, advising the judges to increase all of the marks of the participants in the Triwizard Tournament[1] and later singing gently as Albus Dumbledore was put to rest.[2]  Behind the scenes In the Spanish version of the fourth book, Murcus is the male with the long beard.
