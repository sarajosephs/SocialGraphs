Being able to transform into a falcon at will, he was the first recorded Animagus. For this spectacular magical feat, he was placed on a Chocolate Frog Card.[1]  Contents  1 Magical abilities and skills 2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Magical abilities and skills Transfiguration: Falco mastered the art of Self-Transfiguration and became an Animagus, showing him to have been exceptionally gifted in this highly difficult and complex branch of magic, given the immense skill and dedication required to successfully become an Animagus.[1] Potions: Having become an Animagus, he would have needed to have successfully brewed the Animagus potion, a potion known for being highly advanced, complex and time-consuming, showing his great level of skill in potion-making. Etymology Falco Aesalon is the former scientific name of the European Merlin, before it and the American Merlin were reclassified as the same species.[2]  Behind the scenes Its unknown whether Falco was the first wizard to discover the process of becoming an Animagus, or if other Animagi that were not recorded in magical history did it before him.
