She was the daughter of Bernard Tremblay and Leonie Lestrange, and the sister of Falco. She married Corvus Lestrange and had a son with him, Corvus.[4][5][6]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Clarisse Tremblay was the second wife of Corvus Lestrange, her first cousin.[6] She married him after his first wife, Laurena, had died in childbirth. In 1901, at the age of at least twenty one, she gave birth to a son, named Corvus after his father.[6] At some point thereafter, her son was separated from his family.[4][5] Her later fate is unknown.  Etymology The name Clarisse stems from the Latin word "clarus", meaning "bright or clear." Tremblay is a topographical name that stems from the Old French word "tremblaie", meaning "aspen" or "a place planted with aspens." Behind the scenes Clarisse Tremblay is played by Sabine Crossen in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. The character is named "Mrs Lestrange" on her resume.[7] Appearances Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay (First mentioned) Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film) (Mentioned only) Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay (First appearance) (First identified as Clarisse Lestrange) (Appears in flashback(s)) Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (Appears in flashback(s)) Notes and references   ↑ Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay, Scene 103: Leta says that Corvus "remarried not three months after her [Laurena's] death", which would imply that Clarisse is at least 17 and of age at the time. Laurena died sometime between September and December 1896, so Clarisse was (at least) 17 between December 1896 (three months after the earliest Laurena could have died) and March 1897 (three months after the latest Laurena could have died). March 1897 - 17 = March 1880, which is the latest date she can be born.  ↑ Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay, Scene 103  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 Lestrange family tree (see this image)  ↑ 4.0 4.1 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay, Scene 88  ↑ 5.0 5.1 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay, Scene 96  ↑ 6.0 6.1 6.2 Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (see this image)  ↑ IMDb              Categories         Categories:   Beaufort family descendants    Females    Lestrange family    Married individuals    Parents    Rosier family descendants    Tremblay family    Volant family descendants    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
