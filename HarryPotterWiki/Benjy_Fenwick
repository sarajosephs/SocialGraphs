He fought in the First Wizarding War and was murdered and mutilated by Death Eaters before the war's end.[2] Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Though nothing is known about his early life, it is likely that as a British wizard, he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when he turned eleven and that he had graduated prior to 1981 as the First Wizarding War ended that year.     The orginal Order of the Phoenix   During the First Wizarding War, Fenwick became a member of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation founded and led by Albus Dumbledore, in order to oppose the evil Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Fenwick most likely fought in several battles of the First Wizarding War. Fenwick was brutally murdered by Death Eaters during the war. On the day of his death, a Death Eater presumably fired a deadly curse at Fenwick that blasted him into pieces (possibly the Blasting Curse). The Death Eater then disposed of his remains. According to fellow Order member Alastor Moody, in their search for Fenwick's body they only ever found "bits of him."[2]  Magical abilities and skills Magical skills: To be a member of the Order of the Phoenix, it is highly likely that Fenwick was an accomplished and talented wizard who would have used his magical abilities in a number of battles against the Death Eaters before his untimely death.[2] Behind the scenes On  Pottermore, an image of Benjy has him being of a tanned skin colour but whether this is canon to the series is unknown - the image also has Alice Longbottom as having brown hair when, as her son resembles her, she is most likely (formerly) blonde so there are potential errors or differences between sources. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 2 images related to Benjy Fenwick. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First mentioned) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Possible appearance in Order of the Phoenix photograph) Pottermore (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ Fenwick appeared in a photograph with Marlene McKinnon that was taken two weeks before McKinnon's death in 1981 (Possibly October) . This indicates Fenwick was alive in 1981 and must have been killed sometime between then and Voldemort's fall (31 October, 1981).  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 9 (The Woes of Mrs Weasley)     Order of the Phoenix      Founder:Albus Dumbledore   Leaders:Albus Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Kingsley Shacklebolt   Original Order of of the Phoenix:Aberforth Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Alice Longbottom | Arabella Figg | Benjy Fenwick | Caradoc Dearborn | Dedalus Diggle | Dorcas Meadowes | Edgar Bones | Elphias Doge | Emmeline Vance | Fabian Prewett | Frank Longbottom | Gideon Prewett | James Potter | Lily Potter | Marlene McKinnon | Mundungus Fletcher | Peter Pettigrew (defected) | Remus Lupin | Rubeus Hagrid | Severus Snape | Sirius Black | Sturgis Podmore   Reconstituted Order of the Phoenix: Aberforth Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Arabella Figg | Arthur Weasley | Bill Weasley | Charlie Weasley | Dedalus Diggle | Elphias Doge | Emmeline Vance | Fleur Delacour | Fred Weasley | George Weasley | Harry Potter | Hermione Granger | Hestia Jones | Kingsley Shacklebolt | Minerva McGonagall | Molly Weasley | Mundungus Fletcher | Nymphadora Tonks | Remus Lupin | Ron Weasley | Rubeus Hagrid | Severus Snape | Sirius Black | Sturgis Podmore   Order of the Phoenix allies:Andromeda Tonks | Augusta Longbottom | Buckbeak | Dobby | Fawkes | Filius Flitwick | Firenze | Garrick Ollivander | Ginny Weasley | Grawp | Helena Ravenclaw | Horace Slughorn | Karkus | Karkus's wife | Kreacher | Lee Jordan | Luna Lovegood | McKinnon family | Mr Westenberg | Mrs Westenberg | Muriel | Nearly-Headless Nick | Neville Longbottom | Oliver Wood | Olympe Maxime | Rita Skeeter | Peeves | Percy Weasley | Pomona Sprout | Poppy Pomfrey | Sybill Trelawney | Ted Tonks | The Fallen Fifty | Westenberg family | Winky | Xenophilius Lovegood   Other affiliations:Dumbledore's Army | Forbidden Forest Centaur colony | Headless Hunt | Hogwarts Hippogriff herd | Hogwarts house-elves | Hogwarts Ghosts | Hogwarts Staff | Hogwarts students | Hogwarts Thestral herd | Ministry of Magic | Giant colony (Karkus's control)             Categories         Categories:   1981 deaths    British individuals    Deaths by explosion    Fenwick family    First Order of the Phoenix    First Wizarding War casualties    Males    Murder victims    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
