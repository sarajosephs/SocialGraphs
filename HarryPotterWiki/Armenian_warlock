He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all." — Gilderoy Lockhart[src]  An Armenian warlock was a wizard who saved an entire village from a group of werewolves, including possibly the Wagga Wagga Werewolf. Gilderoy Lockhart took credit for it and wrote a book, titled Wanderings with Werewolves, in which he claimed to have saved the village himself. Lockhart erased this warlock's memory with a Memory Charm to prevent him from "blabbing". Lockhart described him as "ugly" and "old" with "no dress sense".[1]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 16 (The Chamber of Secrets)              Categories         Categories:   Armenian individuals    Males    Unidentified individuals    Warlocks    Wizards             Languages      Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
