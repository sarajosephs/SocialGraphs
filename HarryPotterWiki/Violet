Violet   Biographical information  Died Before 1989[1][2]   Also known as Vi[3]    Physical information  Species Human[4]   Gender Female[4]    Affiliation  Loyalty Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[4]   [Source]    "I really must pay Violet a visit..." — The Fat Lady talking about visiting her friend[src]  Violet was a witch in who had a portrait at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[4]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Behind the scenes 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Her portrait hung in a small chamber off of the Great Hall. Because of this, she witnessed when Harry Potter and the other Triwizard Tournament participants were given the information about the tournament. She was friends with the Fat Lady and is known to go to her painting as well as going other places to find things to gossip about.[4] Violet and the Fat Lady were known to drink too much on special occasions such as Christmas.[3] She also gave Bill Weasley a wink during the Triwizard Tournament.[5]  Behind the scenes It is possible this is Violet Tillyman. Etymology The name "Violet" comes from the English word violet for the purple flower, ultimately derived from Latin viola. It was common in Scotland from the 16th century, and it came into general use as an English given name during the 19th century.  Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 6 images related to Violet.
