The couple had two daughters, Molly and Lucy.[2] It is possible that one or both of their daughters were attending or starting at Hogwarts in 2017, due to the fact that her husband Percy was at King's Cross Station on September 1st that year.[3] While it is unknown as to whether or not she worked at the Ministry, Audrey knew all their rules and regulations in detail, thanks to her husband.[4]  Etymology The name Audrey is of Old English origin, and the meaning of Audrey is "noble strength". Also the root, via Saint Audrey, for the word "tawdry", due to lace and goods sold at Saint Audrey's Fair in England. Saint Audrey was a sixth-century English princess also known as Etheldreda. Literary: Shakespeare used the name for Touchstone's comic sweetheart in "As You Like It".  Appearances J.K.
