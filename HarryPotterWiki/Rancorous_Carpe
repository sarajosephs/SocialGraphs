Rancorous Carpe   Biographical information  Nationality British or Irish[1]    Physical information  Species Human[2]   Gender Male[2]    Affiliation  Occupation Caretaker of Hogwarts Castle[2]   Loyalty Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[2]   [Source]  Rancorous Carpe was the caretaker of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1876.[2] Carpe was the protagonist of the last and most disastrous attempt to have Peeves, the resident poltergeist, removed from the Castle.[2]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography In 1876, Carpe designed an elaborate trap in an attempt to capture and remove Peeves the poltergeist from Hogwarts; the trap included an assortment of weapons which the caretaker believed would be irresistible to Peeves, as well as a vast enchanted bell jar reinforced by various Containment Charms. He believed it would work, but instead Peeves burst through the bell jar, scattering the corridor with broken glass and firing random weapons acquired from the trap. Peeves took control of the castle for three days threatening students with death. The castle had to be evacuated, and it wasn't until the Headmistress, Professor Eupraxia Mole, agreed to sign a contract allowing Peeves to swim in the boys' toilet once each week, to have first choice of stale bread from the kitchens for throwing purposes, and giving him a new colourful custom-made hat by Madame Bonhabille of Paris, that the poltergeist agreed to relinquish the weapons and stand down.[2] Following this incident, Rancorous Carpe took early retirement, citing "health reasons".[2]  Magical abilities and skills Charms: In his elaborate trap which he designed in a failed attempt to capture Peeves, he reinforced the bell jar within it with various Containment Charms, showing he appeared to be skilled with charms.[2] Etymology Rancourous is an English adjective which means "characterised by bitterness and resentment", which is a description that fits many caretakers at Hogwarts. Carpe may also be made to fit the exclamation Carpe diem!. It is used to urge someone to use what they have to succeed. This is how he planned to capture Peeves.
