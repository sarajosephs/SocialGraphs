Apollyon Pringle   Biographical information  Born pre 1944[1]   Blood status Squib or wizard (likely)[2]   Nationality British or Irish[3]    Physical information  Species Human[4]   Gender Male[4]    Relationship information  Family members Pringle (possibly)    Affiliation  Occupation Caretaker of Hogwarts (c. 1961 - c. 1968)[4]   Loyalty Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[4]   [Source]    "He got caught by Apollyon Pringle - he was the caretaker in those days - your father's still got the marks." — Molly Weasley on Pringle's brutal punishments[src]  Apollyon Pringle was the caretaker at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1960s. He was the caretaker of Hogwarts while Arthur and Molly Weasley were attending, which Molly related to Harry Potter and Bill Weasley in 1995 before the third task of the Triwizard Tournament.[4] Apparently Hogwarts allowed him to use corporal punishment on students, as Mrs Weasley told Harry that he caned Arthur for being out late, with her even saying that he still had the marks.[4]  Etymology "Apollyon" is the Greek name for Abaddon, the spiritual being named as "The Destroyer" in Christian apocalyptic theology.  Appearances Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First mentioned) Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ As Apollyon was employed at Hogwarts around 1961, he must have been of age (17) by then.  ↑ As Argus Filch, a Caretaker after him was a Squib, it is possible that he was too, since being caretaking did not explicitly require magic, but he may have been magical.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 31 (The Third Task)          Preceded by:Unknown, eventually Rancorous Carpe  Caretaker of Hogwarts1961 or earlier - 1968 or later  Succeeded by:Unknown, eventually Argus Filch         Hogwarts faculty   Founders  Godric Gryffindor | Helga Hufflepuff | Rowena Ravenclaw | Salazar Slytherin   Headteachers  Giffard Abbott | Walter Aragon | Bearded man holding a book | Phineas Nigellus Black | Elizabeth Burke | Antonia Creaseworthy | Dilys Derwent | Armando Dippet | Albus Dumbledore | Mordicus Egg | Everard | First headmaster | Dexter Fortescue | Basil Fronsac | Brian Gagwilde | Limebert | Minerva McGonagall | Eupraxia Mole | Pink-faced headmaster | Resting headmaster | Edessa Sakndenberg | Brutus Scrimgeour | Phyllida Spore | Severus Snape | Amrose Swott | Quentin Trimble | Dolores Umbridge | Fytherley Undercliffe | Vindictus Viridian | Vulpus | Heliotrope Wilkins | Gimlet-eyed headmistress | Headmaster (1568) | Headteacher (1792) | Headmaster in blue | Headmaster with book | Headmaster in gold | Headmaster with apple | Headmaster with astrolabe | Headmaster with castle sketch | Headmaster with paper | Headmaster with rings | Headmaster with scroll | Headmaster with sphere | Headmaster with starmap | Headmaster with wand   Deputy Heads  Minerva McGonagall | Amycus Carrow | Alecto Carrow   Heads of House  Muldoon Cragg | Filius Flitwick | Godric Gryffindor | Gryffindor lady | Gryffindor man (II) | Gryffindor man (III) | Gryffindor man (IV) | Gryffindor Seeker | Helga Hufflepuff | Neville Longbottom | Minerva McGonagall  | Valeria Myriadd | Uric Oapley | Podric Piles | Prendergast | Rowena Ravenclaw | Horace Slughorn | Salazar Slytherin | Severus Snape | Pomona Sprout | Tobias Stump   Teaching staff  Bartholomew | Bathsheda Babbling | Herbert Beery | Cuthbert Binns | Brindlemore | Charity Burbage | Camelia | Alecto Carrow | Amycus Carrow | Bartemius Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody) | Clodagh Dromgoole | Albus Dumbledore | Eleazar Fig | Firenze | Filius Flitwick | Fortinbras | Jakub Gorski | Olivia Green | Rubeus Hagrid | Hecat | Rolanda Hooch | Ernesto Jags | Arsenius Jigger | Igor Karkaroff's Yule Ball partner | Silvanus Kettleburn | Gilderoy Lockhart | Neville Longbottom | Remus Lupin | Elspeth MacGillony | Mazoni | Minerva McGonagall | Galatea Merrythought | Natsai Onai's mother | Prendergast | Quirinus Quirrell | Patricia Rakepick | Abraham Ronen | Concordia Rowle | Arif Sikander | Aurora Sinistra | Horace Slughorn | Severus Snape | Pomona Sprout | Swoopstikes | Sybill Trelawney | Trocar | Dolores Umbridge | Septima Vector | Unidentified professor | Potions professor (16th century) | Flying Instructor (19th century) | Herbology professor (19th century) | Potions professor (19th century) | DADA professor (1984–1985) | DADA professor (1985–1986) | DADA professor (1986–1987) | DADA professor (1987–1988) | DADA professor (1989–1990) | DADA professor (1990–1991) | Muggle Studies professor (1990s) | DADA professor (1998–?) | Potions professor (21st century) | Charms professor (?th century)   Hogwarts house-elves  Bilm | Boil-ridden house-elf | Deek | Dobby | Filk | Gimkey | Krafty | Kreacher | Pitts | Retch | Vekey | Wigby | Winky | Unidentified house-elf   Support staff  Rancorous Carpe | Argus Filch | Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank | Rubeus Hagrid | Rolanda Hooch | Hankerton Humble | Ogg | Irma Pince | Poppy Pomfrey | Apollyon Pringle | Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus | Wainscott | Unidentified Healers | Unidentified female nurse | Unidentified librarian | Unidentified male nurse             Categories         Categories:   British or Irish individuals    Hogwarts caretakers    Males             Languages      Deutsch Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
