A statue of him was located in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Mrs Norris disappeared behind the statue when she encountered Harry Potter heading towards the Owlery in 1995.[1]  Etymology The name "Wilfred" means "desiring peace" from Old English wil "will, desire" and frið "peace". Saint Wilfrid was a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon bishop. The name was rarely used after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 19th century.
