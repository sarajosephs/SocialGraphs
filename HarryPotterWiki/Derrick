Peregrine Derrick   Biographical information  Born Between 1 September 1976 and 31 August 1977   Nationality British or Irish[1]   Title(s) Beater[2]    Physical information  Species Human[2]   Gender Male[2]    Affiliation  House Slytherin[2]   Loyalty Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[2]Slytherin[2]Slytherin Quidditch team[2]   [Source]  Peregrine Derrick[3] (born c. 1977) was a British wizard who began attending Hogwarts in 1988.[4]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Behind the scenes 4 Etymology 5 Appearances 6 Notes and references   Biography Sorted into Slytherin, Derrick played as a Beater on the Slytherin Quidditch team, along with Lucian Bole, in the 1993–1994 school year.[2] Although there were no Quidditch matches at Hogwarts during the 1994–1995 school year because of the Triwizard Tournament, he held his position on the Slytherin team, at least nominally, until his graduation at the end of term.[4] He and Bole were replaced by Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle at the start of the 1995–1996 school year. Angelina Johnson, the new captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, joked to her teammates that she was always shocked that Derrick and Bole were able to make it on to the Quidditch pitch without having to follow signs.[5]  Magical abilities and skills Flying: Derrick was evidently an accomplished and talented broomstick flyer and Quidditch player, given how he was appointed as a Beater for the Slytherin Quidditch team.[2] Behind the scenes This character is known only by his surname in the Harry Potter books. His first name is given as "Peregrine" in the video game Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup. It is possible that Derrick is the Unidentified Slytherin Beater (II) seen in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and then played from the 1991–1992 school year. Etymology The name "Peregrine" is from the Late Latin name Peregrinus, which meant "traveller". This was the name of several early saints.

This indicates Derrick's seventh year was 1994-1995 and that he kept his position as Beater despite the cancellation of Quidditch matches during the Triwizard Tournament held that same term.  ↑ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 19 (The Lion and the Serpent)     Quidditch positions at Hogwarts      Captains   Filemina Alchin · Astrix Alixan · Orion Amari · Angelina Appleby · Oona Ballington · Concepta Battista · Hugh Biggs · Richard Carter · Angelica Cole · Stuart Craggy · Winky Crockett · Roger Davies · Cedric Diggory · Marcus Flint · Hamish Frater · Stephen Gould · David Hamblin · Natalie Holkham · Jody Jacknife · Angelina Johnson · Jo King · Neil Lament · Steve Laughalot · Graham Montague · Mark Overcliff · Erika Rath · Andrew Snowy Owl · Harry Potter · Isobel Ross · Ashley Sanders · Lucinda Talkalot · Urquhart · Emma Vanity · Charlie Weasley · Rufus Winickus · Oliver Wood · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (I) · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (II)   Keepers   Kevin Bletchley · Miles Bletchley · Brennan Doyle · Andre Egwu · Herbert Fleet · Geoffrey Hooper · Cormac McLaggen · Grant Page · Ron Weasley · Oliver Wood · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Gryffindor Keeper · Unidentified Slytherin Keeper · Unidentified Keeper (I) · Unidentified Keeper (II) · Unidentified Keeper (III)   Chasers   Orion Amari · Tamsin Applebee · Katie Bell · Bradley · Randolph Burrow · Cadwallader · Chambers · Roger Davies · Eekins · Marcus Flint · Rose Granger-Weasley · Jarrett · Angelina Johnson · Heidi Macavoy · Graham Montague · Ethan Parkin · Skye Parkin · James Potter · Malcolm Preece · Adrian Pucey · Demelza Robins · Zacharias Smith · Alicia Spinnet · Jeremy Stretton · Dean Thomas · Urquhart · Vaisey · Cassius Warrington · Ginny Weasley · Blaise Zabini · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Chaser (I) · Unidentified Chaser (II) · Unidentified fourth-year Chaser · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (I) · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (II) · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (III) · Unidentified Gryffindor chaser (IV) · Erika Rath's friend (I) · Erika Rath's friend (II) · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (I)   Beaters   Bean · Lucian Bole · Ritchie Coote · Vincent Crabbe · Peregrine Derrick · Dobbin · Gregory Goyle · Duncan Inglebee · Andrew Kirke · Michael McManus · Maxine O'Flaherty · Jimmy Peakes · Erika Rath · Anthony Rickett · Jason Samuels · Jack Sloper · Fred Weasley · George Weasley · Baglan Wellnelly · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Beater · Unidentified Gryffindor beater · Unidentified Slytherin Beater (I) · Unidentified Slytherin Beater (II) · Unidentified Quidditch Captain (II)   Seekers   Regulus Black · Cho Chang · Cedric Diggory · Andre Egwu · Harper · Terence Higgs · Gilderoy Lockhart · Draco Malfoy · Harry Potter · Summerby · Charlie Weasley · Ginny Weasley · Gruffyd Wellnelly · Jacob's sibling · Unidentified Gryffindor seeker · Unidentified Hufflepuff Seeker · Unidentified Ravenclaw Seeker · Unidentified Ravenclaw Seeker's substitute · Unidentified Seeker (I) · Unidentified Seeker (II)   Unknown positions   Vicky Bishopper · Robin Higgy · R.
