Behind the scenes Phyllida's portrait at the Headmaster's office appears only in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets a large painting of Antonia Creaseworthy occupies that space, and in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince the portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black is hung there. The portrait of Spore that is featured in Goblet of Fire was based on an 1858 portrait of poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806–1861), by Michele Gordigiani. Etymology Her first name is from Greek for "leaf" or "plant." A spore is a body produced by fungi, algae and non-flowering plants that is very protective and resistant to drought.

K. Rowling stated at the Edinburgh Book Festival on 15 August 2004 (source) that all portraits at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are of deceased individuals. Thus, Spore must have died sometime in or before 1995, given her portrait's appearance in the Headmaster's office in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  ↑ "World Exclusive
