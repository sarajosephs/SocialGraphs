Perhaps more to the point, "to babble" in modern vernacular use describes the act of speaking very fast, often in an obscure jargon (as in the phrase "technobabble") — which is fitting for the cryptic language that are the Ancient Runes taught by Babbling. The similar name of "Bathsheba" is the name of the biblical wife of David and mother to Solomon. Behind the scenes Professor Babbling's name only appeared on a list of the Hogwarts professors which was released on J. K. Rowling's website. Rowling may originally have intended a male teacher to teach this subject.[3] Appearances J. K.
