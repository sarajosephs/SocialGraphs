My old house, you know." — The Fat Friar to the first-years before the Sorting Ceremony[src]  The Friar was born no earlier than 982,[1] somewhere in the British Isles.[4] At the age of eleven, the Friar became a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland. He was Sorted into Hufflepuff House and was taught by Helga Hufflepuff in the magical arts the seven years that followed.[6] At some point in his life, he joined the clergy as part of a mendicant religious order, meaning that he spent his life begging in the name of charity. A noble life for a noble man. Apparently, given his physically large appearance, he indulged in the pleasures of food[4] and drink.[5] The Fat Friar's kindness was to be his undoing. He was executed because senior churchmen grew suspicious of his ability to cure the pox merely by poking peasants with a stick, and his ill-advised habit of pulling rabbits out of the communion cup.[7]  Post-mortem    The Fat Friar after his death   The Friar returned from the dead as a ghost, and returned to Hogwarts Castle, where he became the house ghost of his former House, Hufflepuff.[4] He has thus far spent the majority of his afterlife within the castle walls along with the other Hogwarts ghosts. After his death, the Fat Friar retained his kind and joyful demeanour. He eagerly welcomed new students to the school and offered assistance whenever needed.  1985–1986 school year The Fat Friar participated in planning Sir Nicholas' 493rd deathday party when Erling, a friend of his, visited Hogwarts. When he knew that Sir Nicholas and Erling had the same deathday, he suggested eagerly for the two to hold a party together, but it was rejected by Erling. Nevertheless, the Friar guided Erling through a tour in Hogwarts, including the Charms Classroom and the dungeons.[8] During their parties, when he saw neither of them was going on well, he gathered them together and asked again for a collective party, which they agreed. He attended the party and a dance.[9]  1988–1989 school year During this school year, Penny Haywood and Jacob's sibling consulted with the Fat Friar in the Great Hall to inquire if he knew anything about Duncan Ashe or the Marauder's Map. He recommended they seek Sir Nicholas for help finding the map, as he himself was unaware.[10] Later during this school year, Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde spoke to him in the Hufflepuff Common Room to ask if he had seen Peeves. He offered to help but sadly could not give much help as to find Peeves, with him commenting he would know more about curing peasants of the pox.[11]  1991–1992 school year  Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington: "My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?" Fat Friar: "New students! About to be Sorted, I suppose?" — The Fat Friar and Sir Nicholas discussing Peeves[src]  Shortly before the Start-of-Term Feast on 1 September, 1991, the ghosts came across the first years waiting for Professor McGonagall, while discussing whether Peeves should be allowed to attend the Feast (for he had given the house elves quite a bit of trouble, throwing food and breaking dishes). The Friar was excited to see the new students, and smiled around at them. He later attended the Feast, and waved merrily at students being Sorted into Hufflepuff, notably Hannah Abbott.[4] On 2 September, the Friar haunted the Charms Corridor, chanting aloud as he hovered around.[12]  1992–1993 school year  "They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead." — Description of Nicholas' five-hundredth Deathday Party[src]      Fat Friar at Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party   In the evening of 31 October, 1992, the Friar attended Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party, where he engaged in conversation with a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead.[13] This year, the Friar could be usually seen strolling around the Grand Staircase.[14]  1994–1995 school year  "Peeves, of course. The usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the feast — well, it's quite out of the question, you know what he's like, utterly uncivilised, can't see a plate of food without throwing it. We held a ghost's council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his foot down." — Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington telling the trio of the ghost council and about Peeves[src]      The House ghosts of Hogwarts   In the afternoon of 1 September, 1994, the Hogwarts ghosts gathered to decide whether Peeves should be allowed to attend the Start-of-Term Feast. The Fat Friar wanted to give him another chance, but both Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington and the Bloody Baron decided against it, as it was Peeves and he could not and did not want to change, and therefore did not deserve a second chance. As a result, Peeves wreaked havoc in the kitchens, spilling soup all over the place and scattering pots and pans everywhere, scaring the house-elves that were present.[15]  1995–1996 school year  "Dumbledore will be back before long. They couldn't keep him away in our second year and they won't be able to this time. The Fat Friar told me — that Umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they'd searched the castle and grounds for him. Couldn't get past the gargoyle. The Head's office has sealed itself against her. Apparently, she had a right little tantrum." — Ernie Macmillan telling the trio what the Friar told him about Dolores Umbridge[src]      The Friar around the First-floor corridor   By 1995, there was a tetraptych of the Friar hung in the first-floor corridor.[16] He would frequently haunt this area during this school year. It is unknown what he did with the rest of his time. After the Educational Decree Number Twenty-Eight was passed on 21 April, 1996, the Fat Friar saw Dolores Umbridge fruitlessly trying to get access to the Headmaster's Tower, as the tower had sealed itself against her and later told Ernie Macmillan about it.[17] It is safe to assume that like all other residents of Hogwarts that the Friar did not like Umbridges's presence in the school.  1996–1997 school year  "An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and young... The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air." — Description of Albus Dumbledore's funeral[src]      The ghosts of Hogwarts at Albus Dumbledore's funeral   The Fat Friar was present in the castle on 30 June, 1997 when Death Eaters invaded the school. It is unknown if he assisted in the ensuing battle or not. Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, was killed at the hands of Severus Snape in the former's plan on top of the Astronomy Tower.[18] The Hogwarts ghosts were some of the known attendees of his funeral in early July, which most likely included the Friar.[19]  1997–1998 school year  "The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with dishevelled students… Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts." — The students and ghosts moments prior to the battle[src]  On 1 August, 1997, the Ministry of Magic was taken over by Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters.[20] By 1 September, 1997, Severus Snape was made Headmaster of Hogwarts while his fellow Death Eaters, Alecto Carrow and Amycus Carrow became the Muggle Studies and Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers respectively.[21] The Carrows were put in charge of all discipline and punishments, which were violent.  Many people had bruises, cuts, or scars  from the evil siblings. It is likely the Friar, as did the Heads of House, tried to protect the pupils from Alecto and Amycus.[22]      Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the Second Wizarding War   On 2 May, 1998, the Battle of Hogwarts ensued after Lord Voldemort learned Harry Potter was in the premises. The ghosts, likely including the Friar, attended a gathering in the Great Hall, in which Professor McGonagall gave instructions on evacuation of underage students and Kingsley Shacklebolt organised the participants for battle.[23] Later on, the ghosts gathered at the Great Hall, joining the mass mourning over the dead.[24] When the Second Wizarding War came to an end, it is possible that the ghosts (including the Friar) celebrated Harry's victory and Voldemort's demise.[25]  Physical appearance     Fat Friar laughing    " […] looked like a fat little monk […]'" — Description[src]  As a ghost, the Friar was pearly-white and slightly transparent, like all other ghosts.[4] He had short brown hair, which he wore with a small tonsure.[5] At first sight a monk,[4] he was dressed in a habit held by a rope belt.[5] He was fat and short,[4] and usually carried a mug with him.[5]  Personality and traits  "The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her." — Description of the Friar's cheerful deposition [src]  The Friar was very cheerful and welcoming, and happily greeted new students at Hogwarts.[4] He also tended to find something to value in anyone and look past their faults, as he always insisted with the other ghosts to let Peeves attend the Start-of-Term Feasts despite his many wrongdoings.[4][15] He also appeared to be quite sociable, meeting and engaging in conversation with fellow ghosts during Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party.[13] He also seems to have some House pride, as he happily reminisced about his "old House" when welcoming first-years.[4] Despite this, he was always resentful of the fact that he was never made a cardinal.[7] His overly kindness has proven to be his undoing, as he would heal the pox simply by poking with a stick, and pull rabbits out of the communion cup, showing recklessness in terms of concealing his wizardry.  Magical abilities and skills Healing magic: The Fat Friar was a talented Healer, as he could cure sick individuals magically with the touch of his wand. This meant he was remarkably proficient with the casting of Healing spells.[7] Transfiguration: The Fat Friar was proficient with this very advanced branch of magic, as he was able to conjure rabbits from within the communion cup.[7] Conjuration is a particularly difficult form of transfiguration, which is proof of his skill in this field. Behind the scenes     The Fat Friar as depicted in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4   The Friar was portrayed by Simon Fisher-Becker in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the only film he has appeared in. The Friar is the only House ghost whose death was not discussed in the books. The circumstances of his death were finally revealed via  Pottermore. The Fat Friar's name is probably a pun on the term "Fat Fryer"; equipment used to deep fry food, such as chips. It is associated with food, as is the Fat Friar and Hufflepuff in general. Alternatively, the Fat Friar's name could be alliterative and a nod to the character Friar Tuck, as well as the historical Robert Stafford, a real-life chaplain linked to the name Friar Tuck in 1429. The term "Friar" refers to a man who is a member of a religious order which relies on charity, such as in Catholic Christianity. This ties in with the Friar's religious affiliation during his life. It is unknown why a monk would chose to become a ghost rather than move on. Pottermore states that he resented never being appointed cardinal. This may have been the unfinished business that made him choose to return as a ghost. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 35 images related to Fat Friar.

Pottermore states that he was taught by Helga Hufflepuff herself in the 10th century.  ↑ Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, Year 2, "DUELLING DEATHDAY PARTIES" Achievement - Part 1, Side Quest "A Deathday to Remember"  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 4.00 4.01 4.02 4.03 4.04 4.05 4.06 4.07 4.08 4.09 4.10 4.11 4.12 4.13 4.14 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 7 (The Sorting Hat)  ↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) - Chapter 13 (Nick and Other Residents)  ↑ 6.0 6.1 Questions and More Questions on the Harry Potter Lexicon.
