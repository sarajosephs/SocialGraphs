She was noted for her hatred of Muggles. She once tried to get the Ministry of Magic to pass a law that would make Muggle-hunting legal. The bill was most likely turned down.[3]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology Araminta is a name of uncertain origin. It may be an elaborated form of Aminta, which derives from the Greek word amyntor, meaning "defender." Araminta Ross was the birth name of African-American abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Meliflua is presumably based on the English adjective "mellifluous," which means "sweet-sounding" and derives from the Latin mellifluus, "flowing like honey". Behind the scenes Although Sirius Black pointed out Araminta to his godson, Harry Potter, on the Black family tapestry, her name did not appear on the copy of the family tree J. K. Rowling donated to a charity auction in 2006. It's unknown why this is, though the Black Family Tree contains other errors. Araminta's exact relationship to Walburga is unknown, but there are several clues: Scholastic gives Araminta the surname Black, she is depicted on the Black family tree in the books but not on the one auctioned for charity, and she must be more closely related to Walburga than to Walburga's second cousin and husband Orion for their son to remember her as Walburga's cousin alone. This leaves several possibilities: Araminta is descended from Walburga's grandfather Cygnus Black. Walburga is the daughter of his eldest son Pollux, who had three younger siblings: Cassiopeia, who never married, Marius, who was disowned for being a Squib, and Dorea married Charlus Potter and had one son. It is unlikely that a Squib's child would promote Muggle-hunting or be acknowledged by the Black family, so Araminta might be an illegitimate child of Cassiopeia or Dorea. In this case, she would have been left off the auctioned family tree to avoid the scandal of illegitimacy. Araminta and Walburga are cousins through Walburga's mother Irma Crabbe or her grandmother Violetta Bulstrode. Both Crabbes/Bulstrodes married members of the House of Black and had children, but Araminta's branch of the Black family is not descended from Phineas Nigellus Black and therefore do not appear on the segment of the family tree auctioned for charity, which only showed his descendants. Another is that Phineas Black II was disowned after he had Araminta. She rebelled against her father's decision to support Muggle Rights and was reinstated and acknowledged as a True Black. This would make her Walburga's First Cousin Once-Removed. To then further explain why Araminta was not on the auctioned tree is that once disowned, any children from that branch would disappear from the tree. Also, even though the Tapestry in 12 Grimmauld Place might be self-updating, it might only be for the Main branch of the Black family and gives minimal record on cadet branches, except for when a Black cadet branch married into the main line. Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ Araminta has to be alive at least seventeen years before 1995 (1978) to be of age to petition for a law to be passed at a point pre-1995. However, as a cousin of Walburga's, she may be around the same age.  ↑ Her cousins were pure-bloods, and she was not blasted off the Black family tree  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 6 (The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black)  ↑ In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 4 (Horace Slughorn), Horace Slughorn states: "The whole Black family had been in my house, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor!" This implies that all Blacks except Sirius were sorted into Slytherin while Slughorn was teaching at Hogwarts. As revealed in Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies, Chapter 3 (Horace Slughorn), Slughorn had "completed half a century of service" at the time of his retirement in 1981, meaning he started teaching there circa 1931.  ↑ Wizard's Challenge at the Scholastic Official Site              Categories         Categories:   20th century births    Activists    British individuals    Females    House of Black    Pure-bloods    Slytherins    Wizarding supremacists    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Deutsch Español Français Polski      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
