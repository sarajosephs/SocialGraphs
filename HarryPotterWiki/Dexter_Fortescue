Dereliction of duty!" — Fortescue to Phineas Nigellus Black[src]  Shortly after Arthur Weasley was attacked by Nagini at the Department of Mysteries in 1995, Professor Albus Dumbledore attempted to wake up the portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black to tell Sirius Black that Harry Potter and the Weasley children were going to 12 Grimmauld Place. As Phineas expressed unwillingness to help, the portrait of Dexter Fortescue was particularly vocal, as were Armando Dippet and a portrait of a gimlet-eyed Headmistress.[4]   "Blatant corruption! The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!" — Fortescue to Cornelius Fudge and Dolores Umbridge[src]  In 1995, he roared his disapproval at Cornelius Fudge and Dolores Umbridge when the latter explained to the former how she had learned of the first meeting of Dumbledore's Army in the Hog's Head. She explained that Willy Widdershins had been there and had reported back. Minerva McGonagall, also present, commented that she had wondered how Willy had gotten off so lightly after all those Regurgitating Toilets, and Fortescue erupted, saying that they did not cut deals with petty criminals in his day.[5]  1998 When Harry Potter went to the Headmaster's office shortly after Lord Voldemort's defeat and the end of the Second Wizarding War, Fortescue joined the ovation made by the previous Hogwarts Headmaster, waving him his ear trumpet.[7]  Physical appearance Professor Fortescue was described as a corpulent, red-nosed wizard.[4]  Personality and traits Fortescue believed in honour and duty, reprimanding Phineas Nigellus for "dereliction of duty" and bellowing at Cornelius Fudge, Dolores Umbridge, John Dawlish, and Kingsley Shacklebolt for cutting deals with petty criminals.[5] In life, he was hard of hearing, necessitating the use of an ear trumpet before his death. This trait was passed along to his portrait, which used it to listen to private conversations in the Headmaster's office and speaking loudly when addressing observers or other portraits.  Behind the scenes J. K. Rowling has confirmed on  Pottermore that Florean Fortescue, who ran an ice cream parlour in Diagon Alley, is one of his descendants.[6] Etymology The name "Dexter" comes from an occupational surname meaning "one who dyes" in Old English. It also coincides with the Latin word dexter meaning "right-handed, skilled".  Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First appearance) (Appears in portrait(s)) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Appears in portrait(s)) Pottermore (Mentioned only) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 27 (The Centaur and the Sneak) – Fortescue makes reference to "The Ministry [not cutting] deals with petty criminals in [his] day", implying that he lived after the Ministry's inception in 1707.  ↑ J. K. Rowling stated at the Edinburgh Book Festival on 15 August 2004 (source) that all portraits at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are of deceased individuals. Thus, Fortescue must have died sometime in or before 1995, given his portrait's appearance in the Headmaster's office in  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 22 (St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries)  ↑ 5.00 5.01 5.02 5.03 5.04 5.05 5.06 5.07 5.08 5.09 5.10 5.11 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 27 (The Centaur and the Sneak)  ↑ 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 Writing by J.
