Bridget Wenlock's cousin   Biographical information  Born Before 1286   Died After 1202   Nationality Scottish[1]    Physical information  Species Human[1]   Gender Female[1]   Skin colour Pale[1]    Relationship information  Family members Bridget Wenlock (cousin)[1]   [Source]    "Wenlock first scribbled down her ground-breaking theorem on the magical properties of the number seven at breakfast one day apparently on the back of an envelope, using her usual invisible ink. She then proceeded to send her cousin a letter, using what she later believed to be the very envelope concealing the theorem." — Miranda Goshawk, Book of Spells[src]  This individual (fl. 13th century) was a Scottish witch and the cousin of Bridget Wenlock, a celebrated Arithmancer. She lived in John O'Groats, Caithness, Scotland.[1]  Biography Bridget Wenlock once thought she had mistakenly sent an envelope (on which she thought she had scribbled the theorem that led to her discovery of the magical properties of the number seven in Invisible Ink) to her cousin. After chasing the owl that brought the letter and after casting a Revealing Charm, Wenlock found out that the envelope contained no more than a cake recipe, and that she had, in fact, scrawled her calculation on a sugar packet that she had left at home.[1]  Appearances Wonderbook: Book of Spells (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 Wonderbook: Book of Spells - see this video              Categories         Categories:   Deceased individuals    Females    Historical figures    Scottish individuals    Unnamed family members    Wizards             Languages      Polski      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
