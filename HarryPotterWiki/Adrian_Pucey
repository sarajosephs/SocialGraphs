He was a member of Slytherin house, and was a Chaser on the Slytherin Quidditch team.[3]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Personality and traits 3 Behind the scenes 4 Etymology 5 Appearances 6 Notes and references   Biography    Marcus, Adrian and Draco before a Quidditch Match   Adrian Pucey likely began attending Hogwarts in 1989 or 1990 and was sorted into the Slytherin house. He made it onto the Slytherin Quidditch team and played the role of Chaser.[3] Adrian was on the Slytherin team in Harry Potter's first year up to and including his fifth year (except for the third year, when Marcus Flint, Cassius Warrington and Graham Montague are said to be the three Chasers); hence, he was no more than two years ahead of Harry, assuming that he did not need to repeat a year, like Marcus Flint.[3]  Personality and traits He was notable for being one of the few Slytherin Quidditch players who was not seen to commit a foul or otherwise cheat, despite being on the Quidditch team for at least three years.[3]  Behind the scenes Adrian Pucey was played by Scot Fearn in the first two films, but due to a series of errors in the closing credits of Philosopher's Stone, he was listed as having played Terence Higgs (his name was additionally misspelled as "Scott Fern" therein), while David Holmes was wrongly credited as Pucey and Will Theakston (Higgs) as Marcus Flint.[4] These errors were corrected in Chamber of Secrets, though both Fearn's and Jamie Yeates' names contained spelling errors.[5] Etymology The name Adrian is derived from the Roman name Hadrian, who was an emperor of Rome who gave his name to Hadrian's Wall in England. Adrian means "from Adria", a port on the Adriatic Sea, and was the regnal name of the first and only English pope, Adrian IV. Pucey may be from puce, a deep red to dark greyish purple, and from the French word for "flea". Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 8 images related to Adrian Pucey.

He was still on the team in Harry's fifth year, meaning he was most likely one or two years above Harry Potter.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.00 3.01 3.02 3.03 3.04 3.05 3.06 3.07 3.08 3.09 3.10 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 11 (Quidditch)  ↑ IMDb: Philosopher's Stone Credits  ↑ IMDb: Chamber of Secrets Credits  ↑ Although Adrian is never identified, the complete Slytherin Quidditch team appeared in the game adaptation.
