Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important Wizarding institutions. As they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere...." — Albus Dumbledore telling Harry Potter about Everard and Dilys Derwent[src]  Professor Everard was one of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry's most celebrated Heads. His portrait hangs in the Headmaster's Office and in the Ministry of Magic's Headquarters.[3]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 As Headmaster of Hogwarts 1.2 Post-mortem   2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography As Headmaster of Hogwarts Everard was made Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in an unknown time period.[3]  Post-mortem  "The man has red hair and glasses. Everard, you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right people —" — Albus Dumbledore instructing Everard's portrait to help Arthur Weasley[src]  After his death, he was remembered as one of the most celebrated Heads of Hogwarts.[3] When Arthur Weasley was attacked by Nagini in the Department of Mysteries in late 1995, Albus Dumbledore, then Headmaster, asked Everard to go to his portrait at the Ministry of Magic's Headquarters in order to warn others that Mr Weasley was injured at the Department.[3] In June 1997, following the Death Eater attack on Hogwarts and the death of Albus Dumbledore, he informed Professor Minerva McGonagall that Rufus Scrimgeour was on his way, having just disapparated from the Ministry of Magic.[4]  Etymology The name "Everard" means "brave boar", derived from the Germanic elements eber, "wild boar" and hard, "brave", "hardy". The Normans introduced it to England, where it joined the Old English cognate Eoforheard. It has only been rarely used since the Middle Ages. Modern use of the name may be inspired by the surname Everard, itself derived from the medieval name.  Behind the scenes The style of clothing in his portrait suggests that he possibly lived in the 18th or 19th century. Everard was portrayed by late Sam Beazley in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Everard is described as having short, black bangs in the novel, but Beazley portrays him as having greying hair. In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, he is shown to be holding a first-aid kit when Albus Dumbledore tells him to find the injured Arthur Weasley.

K. Rowling stated at the Edinburgh Book Festival on 15 August 2004 (source) that all portraits at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are of deceased individuals. Thus, Everard must have died sometime in or before 1995, given his portrait's appearance in the Headmaster's office in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 22 (St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 29 (The Phoenix Lament)        Preceded by:Unknown, eventually Amrose Swott  Headmaster of Hogwarts17th century  Succeeded by:Unknown, eventually Vindictus Viridian         Hogwarts faculty   Founders  Godric Gryffindor | Helga Hufflepuff | Rowena Ravenclaw | Salazar Slytherin   Headteachers  Giffard Abbott | Walter Aragon | Bearded man holding a book | Phineas Nigellus Black | Elizabeth Burke | Antonia Creaseworthy | Dilys Derwent | Armando Dippet | Albus Dumbledore | Mordicus Egg | Everard | First headmaster | Dexter Fortescue | Basil Fronsac | Brian Gagwilde | Limebert | Minerva McGonagall | Eupraxia Mole | Pink-faced headmaster | Resting headmaster | Edessa Sakndenberg | Brutus Scrimgeour | Phyllida Spore | Severus Snape | Amrose Swott | Quentin Trimble | Dolores Umbridge | Fytherley Undercliffe | Vindictus Viridian | Vulpus | Heliotrope Wilkins | Gimlet-eyed headmistress | Headmaster (1568) | Headteacher (1792) | Headmaster in blue | Headmaster with book | Headmaster in gold | Headmaster with apple | Headmaster with astrolabe | Headmaster with castle sketch | Headmaster with paper | Headmaster with rings | Headmaster with scroll | Headmaster with sphere | Headmaster with starmap | Headmaster with wand   Deputy Heads  Minerva McGonagall | Amycus Carrow | Alecto Carrow   Heads of House  Muldoon Cragg | Filius Flitwick | Godric Gryffindor | Gryffindor lady | Gryffindor man (II) | Gryffindor man (III) | Gryffindor man (IV) | Gryffindor Seeker | Helga Hufflepuff | Neville Longbottom | Minerva McGonagall  | Valeria Myriadd | Uric Oapley | Podric Piles | Prendergast | Rowena Ravenclaw | Horace Slughorn | Salazar Slytherin | Severus Snape | Pomona Sprout | Tobias Stump   Teaching staff  Bartholomew | Bathsheda Babbling | Herbert Beery | Cuthbert Binns | Brindlemore | Charity Burbage | Camelia | Alecto Carrow | Amycus Carrow | Bartemius Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody) | Clodagh Dromgoole | Albus Dumbledore | Eleazar Fig | Firenze | Filius Flitwick | Fortinbras | Jakub Gorski | Olivia Green | Rubeus Hagrid | Hecat | Rolanda Hooch | Ernesto Jags | Arsenius Jigger | Igor Karkaroff's Yule Ball partner | Silvanus Kettleburn | Gilderoy Lockhart | Neville Longbottom | Remus Lupin | Elspeth MacGillony | Mazoni | Minerva McGonagall | Galatea Merrythought | Natsai Onai's mother | Prendergast | Quirinus Quirrell | Patricia Rakepick | Abraham Ronen | Concordia Rowle | Arif Sikander | Aurora Sinistra | Horace Slughorn | Severus Snape | Pomona Sprout | Swoopstikes | Sybill Trelawney | Trocar | Dolores Umbridge | Septima Vector | Unidentified professor | Potions professor (16th century) | Flying Instructor (19th century) | Herbology professor (19th century) | Potions professor (19th century) | DADA professor (1984–1985) | DADA professor (1985–1986) | DADA professor (1986–1987) | DADA professor (1987–1988) | DADA professor (1989–1990) | DADA professor (1990–1991) | Muggle Studies professor (1990s) | DADA professor (1998–?) | Potions professor (21st century) | Charms professor (?th century)   Hogwarts house-elves  Bilm | Boil-ridden house-elf | Deek | Dobby | Filk | Gimkey | Krafty | Kreacher | Pitts | Retch | Vekey | Wigby | Winky | Unidentified house-elf   Support staff  Rancorous Carpe | Argus Filch | Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank | Rubeus Hagrid | Rolanda Hooch | Hankerton Humble | Ogg | Irma Pince | Poppy Pomfrey | Apollyon Pringle | Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus | Wainscott | Unidentified Healers | Unidentified female nurse | Unidentified librarian | Unidentified male nurse             Categories         Categories:   British or Irish individuals    Historical figures    Hogwarts Headmasters and Headmistresses    Males    Portraits    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Português do Brasil Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
