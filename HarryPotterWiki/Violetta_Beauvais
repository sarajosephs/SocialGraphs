They share their name with a shade of purple, a popular colour among wizards Beauvais is a French surname, from beau ("beautiful") + vais ("to go (away)"). Violetta may be named after René Beauvais, a carpenter and master woodcarver from Lower Canada known for his extensive work on churches.  Behind the scenes Since Rappaport's Law required  a Wand permit, it is unknown how users of these wands would apply for a permit as the wand Permit application requires the applicant to tell the Wand Permit Office details of the wand. It might be that she was required to inform the Federal Wand Permit Officer.  Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film) (mentioned in a newspaper and on wand permit application) Notes and references   ↑ Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film) (see this image) - She was likely of age by the time she was a recognised wandmaker in 1926.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 Writing by J.
