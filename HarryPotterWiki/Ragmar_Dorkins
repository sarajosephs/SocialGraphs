Biography In June 1998, Ragmar gave a statement to the Daily Prophet pleading patience from Chudley Cannon fans after his team lost 350-0 in a game against the Appleby Arrows[1].  Later, in February 1999, the Daily Prophet took note of Ragmar's delight when the Chudley Cannons drew a match against the Caerphilly Catapults, breaking their 16 game losing streak[2].  In June 1999, the Chudley Cannons losing streak was broken when they won a game against the Wigtown Wanderers, and Ragmar told the Daily Prophet that it was "the happiest day of my life"[3]. In October 1999, the Daily Prophet noted Ragmar "collapsed in shock" after the Chudley Cannons won their second game in a row[4], against the Falmouth Falcons.
