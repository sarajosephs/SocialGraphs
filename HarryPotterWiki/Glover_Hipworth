He became famous for the invention of the Pepperup Potion, the cure for the common cold.[1]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Early life 1.2 Adulthood   2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography Early life Glover Hipworth was born in 1742. If he enrolled at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he attended the school from around 1753-1760, under Headmistress Dilys Derwent.  Adulthood  "Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward." — Description[src] It is likely Hipworth studied further into Potion-making, becoming a fully-fledged potioneer in his adult years. Sometime in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries, Glover Hipworth developed the Pepperup Potion, based on an earlier remedy by 12th century potioneer Linfred of Stinchcombe, used today as an efficacious magical remedy for the common cold.[1] By the 1990s, Hipworth was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card, which pictured him symbolically sneezing, in a reference to his achievement.[1] In the 1993–1994 school year a portrait of him guarded a secret room in the Dungeons, at Hogwarts Castle; the password was Gesundheit (the German word for "health", also used for "Bless you").[2]  Magical abilities and skills Potions: Hipworth was a professional Potioneer and was highly proficient in the art of brewing potions, having invented the Pepperup Potion, a Healing potion which remedies the effects of the Common cold. For his achievement, he was included on a Chocolate Frog Card, showing the great level of talent he possessed in this branch of magic and science.
