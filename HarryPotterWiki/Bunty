Upon Newt's decision to travel to Paris in search of Credence Barebone, he left Bunty a note informing her of his travels, and asking her to look after his creatures in his absence.[8]  1932      Bunty whispers something to Newt   Bunty aided Newt, Dumbledore and his friends in their plans to stop Gellert Grindelwald from becoming the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, preparing several identical cases to Newt's suitcase. Bunty took one of the suitcases herself and joined them.       Bunty after giving Newt the Qilin   During the ceremony, a disguised Bunty approached Newt carrying the real suitcase, allowing him to release the Qilin and expose Grindelwald's lies. She subsequently joined all of the gathered witches and wizards in attacking Grindelwald, forcing him to retreat.[9]  Later life Bunty was still working with Newt by the 1988–1989 school year. During this time, Bunty attempted to aid Newt in cleaning the teeth of one of his Leucrottas, but was unsuccessful as a result of the beast refusing to open his mouth.[10]  Personality and traits      Bunty loving her job as Newt's assistant   Bunty was clearly a compassionate young witch with a keen interest and passion in caring for magical creatures as Newt Scamander's assistant. Newt Scamander regarded her to be a trustworthy and reliable individual, so much so he granted her permission to access his home to care for his many creatures whilst on his travels. Due to her enthusiasm and effort as Newt's assistant along with her passionate caring for his various beasts, it can be presumed she also held his passion and interest in Magizoology very highly.[8]  Magical abilities and skills Care of Magical Creatures: Bunty was shown to be skilled in the caring and handling of various magical creatures, being very able to care for Newt's creatures as his assistant. In particular, she was shown handling and caring for several baby Nifflers very competently and carefully and was trusted by Newt to care for his larger and more dangerous beasts.[8] Nonverbal magic: Bunty was capable of casting nonverbal spells with ease, as she was able to fire offensive spells at Gellert Grindelwald in Bhutan with other wizards.[9] Personal possessions Wand: Bunty owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, wand wood and wand core material.[3] Etymology The name "Bunty" has multiple origins and uses, mostly animal-related, including: As a term of endearment that stems from a dialect name for lamb that means "to butt". Bunting is a form of animal behaviour, often found in cats, in which the animal butts or rubs their head against other things, including people. It is generally considered to be a form of territorial scent-marking behaviour, where the cat rubs the scent glands on their cheeks and forehead on the object being marked. Stemming from the English and Scottish word buntin, meaning "plump". The name Bunting is given to a group of Eurasian and African passerine birds of the family Emberizidae. Behind the scenes      Bunty's promotional poster for Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore   Bunty is played by Victoria Yeates in the second and third instalments[11] of the Fantastic Beasts film series.[6] J. K. Rowling devised a "fully fleshed" backstory for her (in a similar sentiment of what she disclosed about minor characters of the Harry Potter book series, such as Dean Thomas, Theodore Nott, and Filius Flitwick). Rowling provided Eddie Redmayne and Victoria Yeates three pages of original text about the origin of Bunty's relationship with Newt.[7] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 46 images related to Bunty Broadacre.
