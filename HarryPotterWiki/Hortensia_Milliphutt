Biography She had the distinction of being the Minister who introduced the most legislation during her term in office. Much of this new legislation was useful, but her political downfall came when she started passing regulations on hat pointiness and other wearisome laws.[2]  Appearances Pottermore (Mentioned only) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ According to  Pottermore, Nobby Leach (Minister for Magic between 1962 and 1968) was the first Muggle-born wizard ever to be appointed to the office.  ↑ Writing by J.
