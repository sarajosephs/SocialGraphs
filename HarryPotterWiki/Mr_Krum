Mr Krum   Biographical information  Born In or before 1945 (possibly)[1]   Marital status Married   Nationality Bulgarian    Physical information  Species Human   Gender Male   Hair colour Dark    Relationship information  Family members Viktor's grandfather (father or father-in-law) †Mrs Krum (wife)Viktor Krum (son)    Affiliation  Loyalty Krum family   [Source]  Mr Krum (fl. 1977-1995) was a Bulgarian wizard, who was the father of Viktor Krum.[2]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Physical appearance 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography Mr Krum travelled to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with his wife to watch Viktor face the final task of the Triwizard Tournament in 1995.[2] Viktor told Harry Potter that his grandfather was killed by Gellert Grindelwald.[3] This man could have been either Mr Krum's father or his father-in-law.  Physical appearance He was described as having dark hair and a hooked nose like his son.[2]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ Viktor Krum's grandfather died in 1945. If Mr Krum is his son then he must have been born in or before 1945, as Victor's grandfather was dead after 1945 and could not have conceived him - if he was his son - any later.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 31 (The Third Task)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 8 (The Wedding)              Categories         Categories:   Bulgarian individuals    Krum family    Males    Married individuals    Parents    Unnamed family members    Wizards             Languages      Français Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
