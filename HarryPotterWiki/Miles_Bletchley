He was a member of the Slytherin Quidditch team, serving as their Keeper.[3]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 1991–1992 school year 1.2 1992–1993 school year 1.3 1995–1996 school year   2 Personality and traits 3 Magical abilities and skills 4 Behind the scenes 5 Etymology 6 Appearances 7 Notes and references   Biography 1991–1992 school year Bletchley played in Slytherin's match against Gryffindor this year. He was unable to block Gryffindor's only goal attempt during that match, from Angelina Johnson.[3]  1992–1993 school year Bletchley, along with the rest of the team, received a new Nimbus 2001 this year from Lucius Malfoy as an incentive to allow his son Draco onto the team as Seeker. He and the rest of the team flaunted these new broomsticks to the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He laughed along with the other members of the team at Ronald Weasley when his broken wand redirected an attempted Slug-Vomiting Charm back at him.[4]  1995–1996 school year During this year, Bletchley took part in a small plot by the Slytherin Quidditch team to jinx various members of the Gryffindor team prior to their first match. He hit Alicia Spinnet with a jinx that made her eyebrows grow excessively large. Despite doing this in front of fourteen witnesses, Severus Snape, who seemed to support this action, merely chose to assume she had used a poorly applied Hair-Thickening Charm on herself, and Bletchley was not punished.[5] Later, during the match itself, Bletchley managed to save at least one attempted goal by Angelina Johnson. He, along with the rest of his team and the Slytherin supporters, sang "Weasley is Our King" throughout the match in a successful attempt to unnerve Ron Weasley, Gryffindor's new Keeper.[5]  Personality and traits Miles was a mean-spirited individual who lacked good sportsmanship. He took enjoyment in mocking others,[4] and evidently saw no problem with foul play against members of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.[5]  Magical abilities and skills Flying: Miles played as Keeper for the Slytherin Quidditch team at Hogwarts, meaning he was a fairly accomplished and talented broomstick flyer and Quidditch player.[3] Dark Arts: Miles jinxed Alicia Spinnet with an unpleasant jinx that caused her eyebrows to grow rapidly, meaning he had some skill with Dark charms.[5] Behind the scenes In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the Slytherin Keeper was played by Amy Puglia, despite there never having been any girls on the Slytherin squad in the books. In Chamber of Secrets, he instead was played by David Churchyard. In the video game Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup, the Slytherin Keeper is named "Kevin Bletchley". It is possible this was intended to be Miles. Etymology "Miles" is from the Germanic name Milo, introduced by the Normans to England in the form Miles. The meaning is not known for certain. It is possibly connected to the Slavic name element mil meaning "gracious". From an early date it was associated with Latin miles "soldier".

He was still on the team in Harry's fifth year, meaning he was most likely one or two years above Harry Potter.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.00 3.01 3.02 3.03 3.04 3.05 3.06 3.07 3.08 3.09 3.10 Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 11 (Quidditch)  ↑ 4.0 4.1 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)  ↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 19 (The Lion and the Serpent)  ↑ Although Miles is never identified, the complete Slytherin Quidditch team appeared in the video game adaptation.
