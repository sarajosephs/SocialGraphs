Fabian was a member of the original Order of the Phoenix. He and his brother fought in the First Wizarding War, both were murdered by five Death Eaters before the war's end.[3]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Post-mortem   2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 Behind the scenes 5 Appearances 6 Notes and references   Biography Fabian was born into the wizarding Prewett family, with two known siblings: Gideon and Molly. During the First Wizarding War, his sister Molly married Arthur Weasley, and the couple eventually had seven children. Fabian also may have had a big nose.[4] During the First Wizarding War, Fabian and his brother decided to join the ranks of the Order of the Phoenix to fight against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.[3] Eventually, however, Fabian and Gideon were attacked by five Death Eaters, one of whom was Antonin Dolohov. They were described as having "fought like heroes" by fellow Order member Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, though both were ultimately killed. Following Voldemort's fall from power, Dolohov, and perhaps others involved in the Prewetts' "brutal" murders, were imprisoned in Azkaban for the crime.[3]  Post-mortem It is unknown how Molly responded to her brother's deaths, but she was most likely heartbroken, given how much she loved her family. She often spoke fondly of them to others. In 1997, Molly gave Fabian's gold watch to Harry Potter on his seventeenth birthday, as it was traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age. Harry treasured and preserved it throughout the Second Wizarding War, keeping it and wearing it well into his thirties. She also stated that Fabian was not "terribly careful" with his possession, as the watch was dented on the back. Unlike normal watches, it had stars as the clock's hands.[5]  Magical abilities and skills Magical mastery: Along with his brother Gideon, Fabian was a highly-respected member of the Order of the Phoenix, implying that he was proficient in many areas of magic. Alastor Moody noted that it took five Death Eaters, including the particularly sadistic Antonin Dolohov, to kill Fabian and his brother.[3] Etymology Fabian is the English form of the Latin Fabianus, which was the name given to emancipated slaves in Rome. It is derived from Fabius, the name of a very influential Roman patrician family, whose members included many politicians and soldiers. The most notable of the Fabian family was Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, who was given the epithet Cunctator, "the Delayer", because of the unorthodox strategies he employed in the Second Punic War against Hannibal. He developed the Fabian strategy of warfare.  Behind the scenes While Fabian and Gideon are mentioned as having been members of the Order, their sister Molly was not, most likely because she was raising her children, Fabian's nephews, during the First Wizarding War. It is possible Fabian's sister honoured Fabian and Gideon with the naming of her twin sons. Fred, one of her twins, has the same first initial as Fabian, 'F'. Her other son, George, has the same initial 'G'. Gideon and Fabian may also have been twins themselves, though it has yet to be confirmed or denied. It is widely believed that since twins run in families this increases the odds, however identical twins, such as Fred and George, do not run in families so in reality this gives no extra weight to the theory.

This indicates Gideon was alive in 1981 and must have been killed sometime between then and Voldemort's fall (31 October, 1981).  ↑ Pottermore states that she was "technically Mrs Weasley's great aunt" making the Fabian her great nephew  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 9 (The Woes of Mrs Weasley)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (script): Fred states that George's nose looks "positively massive" and is corrected that it is his - he says it is a family trait from Molly, implying that Gideon and Fabian may have had a big nose too.  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 7 (The Will of Albus Dumbledore)       Order of the Phoenix      Founder:Albus Dumbledore   Leaders:Albus Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Kingsley Shacklebolt   Original Order of of the Phoenix:Aberforth Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Alice Longbottom | Arabella Figg | Benjy Fenwick | Caradoc Dearborn | Dedalus Diggle | Dorcas Meadowes | Edgar Bones | Elphias Doge | Emmeline Vance | Fabian Prewett | Frank Longbottom | Gideon Prewett | James Potter | Lily Potter | Marlene McKinnon | Mundungus Fletcher | Peter Pettigrew (defected) | Remus Lupin | Rubeus Hagrid | Severus Snape | Sirius Black | Sturgis Podmore   Reconstituted Order of the Phoenix: Aberforth Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Arabella Figg | Arthur Weasley | Bill Weasley | Charlie Weasley | Dedalus Diggle | Elphias Doge | Emmeline Vance | Fleur Delacour | Fred Weasley | George Weasley | Harry Potter | Hermione Granger | Hestia Jones | Kingsley Shacklebolt | Minerva McGonagall | Molly Weasley | Mundungus Fletcher | Nymphadora Tonks | Remus Lupin | Ron Weasley | Rubeus Hagrid | Severus Snape | Sirius Black | Sturgis Podmore   Order of the Phoenix allies:Andromeda Tonks | Augusta Longbottom | Buckbeak | Dobby | Fawkes | Filius Flitwick | Firenze | Garrick Ollivander | Ginny Weasley | Grawp | Helena Ravenclaw | Horace Slughorn | Karkus | Karkus's wife | Kreacher | Lee Jordan | Luna Lovegood | McKinnon family | Mr Westenberg | Mrs Westenberg | Muriel | Nearly-Headless Nick | Neville Longbottom | Oliver Wood | Olympe Maxime | Rita Skeeter | Peeves | Percy Weasley | Pomona Sprout | Poppy Pomfrey | Sybill Trelawney | Ted Tonks | The Fallen Fifty | Westenberg family | Winky | Xenophilius Lovegood   Other affiliations:Dumbledore's Army | Forbidden Forest Centaur colony | Headless Hunt | Hogwarts Hippogriff herd | Hogwarts house-elves | Hogwarts Ghosts | Hogwarts Staff | Hogwarts students | Hogwarts Thestral herd | Ministry of Magic | Giant colony (Karkus's control)             Categories         Categories:   1981 deaths    Blood traitors    English individuals    First Order of the Phoenix    First Wizarding War casualties    Killed by Antonin Dolohov    Males    Murder victims    Prewett family    Pure-bloods    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Français Nederlands Português Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
