This article is about the French half-elf. You may be looking for Irma Pince, the Hogwarts librarian or Irma Black (née Crabbe), a member of the House of Black.         Irma Dugard   Biographical information  Born Before 1896   Died Early September 1927, 18 Rue Philippe Lorand, Paris, France   Blood status Half-elf   Nationality French    Physical information  Species Half-elf   Gender Female    Affiliation  Occupation Housekeeper of the Lestrange family   Loyalty Lestrange family   [Source]  Irma Dugard was a French half-elf who worked as a housekeeper for the Lestrange family. She took care of the young Credence Barebone, signing his adoption paper.  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 1896 1.2 1901 1.3 1927   2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography 1896 She was present at the birth of Leta Lestrange and the death of Laurena Kama.  1901 In c. 1901 Irma Dugard was working for Corvus Lestrange. After the birth of his son, Corvus, the former sent the half-elf with his two children, the other being Leta Lestrange, to New York for them to be adopted by Mary Lou Barebone. Corvus was being targeted by Yusuf Kama, and he was sent away for his safety. Irma and the children posed as a grandmother with two grandchildren. They boarded a ship, where Irma met a woman travelling with her nephew. Presumably they became acquainted with each other, since the woman would call her by her given name. On the trip however, there was a commotion and Irma left her cabin to investigate it. Meanwhile frustrated with Corvus' constant screaming, Leta Lestrange exchanged her half-brother with another baby, the woman's nephew, who turned out to be Credence Barebone, saving the latter's life as the ship they were travelling on sunk during a storm. When Irma realised the ship was sinking, she went back to the cabin for the children, only to find Leta in the corridor with a baby, whom she presumed to be Corvus. She took the child from Leta and dragged her along as they left the ship. They escaped in lifeboats, but Irma never learned that Corvus died.[1]  1927 In 1927, she was visited by Credence, who wanted to learn the truth about his family.[2] After an unfortunately short meeting, she was killed by Gunnar Grimmson on Gellert Grindelwald's orders.[3]  Etymology "Irma" is a German short form of names beginning with the Old Germanic element ermen, meaning "whole" or "universal". "Dugard" is likely derived from the French du garde which translates to "of the guard". Behind the scenes Irma Dugard was portrayed by the late French actress Danielle Hugues in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.
