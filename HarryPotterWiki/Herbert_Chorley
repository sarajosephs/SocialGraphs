The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck." Muggle Prime Minister: "What about him?" Rufus Scrimgeour: "He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse. It’s addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous." Muggle Prime Minister: "He’s only quacking! Surely a bit of a rest... Maybe go easy on the drink..." — Rufus Scrimgeour and the Muggle Prime Minister discussing Chorley's peculiar mental state[src]  Herbert Chorley was a Muggle Junior minister in 1996. He was placed under a botched Imperius Curse, leaving him acting like a duck. Ministry of Magic officials placed him in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for treatment. It was stated that he nearly strangled three of the healers, and therefore had to be removed from Muggle society for a while.[1] It is unknown if he ever recovered.  Etymology The name "Herbert" is derived from the Germanic elements hari "army" and beraht "bright". The Normans introduced this name to England, where it replaced an Old English cognate Herebeorht.
