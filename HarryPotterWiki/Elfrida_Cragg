This article is about a witch whose portrait hung at the Headquarters of the Ministry of Magic. You may be looking for the once-Chieftainess of the Wizards' Council.   Elfrida Cragg   Biographical information  Died Before 1995[1]   Nationality British[2]    Physical information  Species Human[2]   Gender Female[2]    Relationship information  Family members Muldoon Cragg (possibly)    Affiliation  Loyalty British Ministry of Magic[2]   [Source]    "He doesn’t look good, he’s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida Cragg’s portrait to get a good view as they left —" — Everard's portrait to Albus Dumbledore[src]  Elfrida Cragg was a witch, whose portrait hung at the Headquarters of the British Ministry of Magic. On 18 December 1995, Everard went into her portrait to find out what happened to Arthur Weasley following the attack on him by Nagini in the Department of Mysteries.[2]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology The name "Elfrida" is from the Old English name Ælfþryð, meaning "elf strength" from the element ælf combined with þryð, "strength". Ælfþryð was a 10th-century queen of England. This name was rare after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 19th century.  Behind the scenes Elfrida Cragg is possibly a misspelling of Elfrida Clagg. This is likely, as Clagg was a celebrated Chieftainess of the Wizards' Council, the organisation that preceded the Ministry of Magic in Britain, and hence would be likely to have a portrait commemorating her at the Ministry.
