Barnabas the Barmy   Physical information  Species Human   Gender Male   [Source]  Barnabas the Barmy was a wizard who made a bizarre and foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet.[1] A moving tapestry depicting his attempt hung on the seventh floor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, opposite the entrance to the Room of Requirement.[2]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology "Barnabas" is a Greek form of an Aramaic name. In Acts in the New Testament the byname Barnabas was given to a man named Joseph, a companion of Paul on his missionary journeys. The original Aramaic is unattested, but it may be from בּר נביא (bar naviya') meaning "son of the prophet", though in Acts 4:36 it is claimed that the name means "son of encouragement". As an English name, it came into occasional use after the 12th century. According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the word "barmy" is an informal adjective, chiefly used in Britain that means mad, crazy or extremely foolish. Behind the scenes Actor Mason Kayne was considered for the role of Barnabas the Barmy to in the tapestry outside the Room of Requirement in the film, but the scenes were never filmed and the tapestry is not present in the corridor.[citation needed] Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First appearance) (Appears on a tapestry) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Appears on a tapestry) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game) (Appears on a tapestry) Harry Potter: The Creature Vault (Appears on a tapestry) Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (Mentioned only) Harry Potter: Wizards Unite (Mentioned only) Harry Potter: Magic Awakened (Mentioned in History of Magic classes) Notes and references   ↑ Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 18 (Dumbledore's Army)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)              Categories         Categories:   Historical figures    Males    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Nederlands Polski Русский Svenska 中文      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
