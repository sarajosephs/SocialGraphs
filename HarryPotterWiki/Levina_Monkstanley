Levina Monkstanley   Biographical information  Nationality British[1]    Physical information  Species Human[1]   Gender Female[1]    Affiliation  Occupation Unspeakable[1]   Loyalty British Ministry of Magic[1]Department of Mysteries[1]   [Source]  Levina Monkstanley (fl. 1772) was a British witch who worked as an Unspeakable for the Department of Mysteries in the British Ministry of Magic.[1]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography An accomplished witch, Levina Monkstanley was the one who first developed the Wand-Lighting Charm, Lumos, and the Wand-Extinguishing Charm, Nox. She astonished her colleagues one day by lighting the tip of her wand to look for a dropped quill in a dusty corner.[1]  Magical abilities and skills Spell creation: Levina successfully created the Wand-Lighting Charm, along with the Wand-Extinguishing Charm, its counter-charm.[1] Charms: Levina was clearly good with charms, given how she invented the Wand-Lighting Charm and Wand-Extinguishing Charm in her lifetime, and put them both to great use in her career at the Department of Mysteries.[1] Etymology Levina is of uncertain origin. It may derive from the Russian for lion (lev), the Latin name "Lavinia," or the word "levin," an archaic term for a lightning bolt. Monkstanley appears to be a combination of the two real-world surnames Monk, an occupational surname which ultimately descends from the Greek for "solitary," and Stanley, which is of English origin and means "the stony meadow."
