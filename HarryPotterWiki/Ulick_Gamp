He held the office from 1707 to 1718.[5]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Early life 1.2 Ministry career 1.3 Legacy   2 Physical appearance 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Early life Ulick Gamp likely was born sometime before 1690.  Ministry career After graduating, he joined the Wizards' Council and became a member of Wizengamot. In 1707, after the abolishment of the Council, he became the first British Minister of Magic. Gamp had the onerous job of policing a fractious and frightened community adjusting to the imposition of the International Statute of Secrecy. His greatest legacy was to found the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. During Gamp's term, the Ministry outlawed the use of the Cruciatus, Imperius and Killing Curses, dubbing them "unforgivable".[6] During the early years of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, when the fate of the popular wizarding pub The Leaky Cauldron was uncertain, Gamp agreed to bestow the landlord the responsibility of letting people into Diagon Alley, being sensitive to the needs of the patrons. To honour Gamp’s protection of the pub, the landlord created a new brand of beer in his name, Gamp's Old Gregarious.[7] Gamp was elected Minister at least twice before resigning or being voted out of office in 1718.  Legacy    Gamp's portrait   He was depicted in a portrait hung at the Prime Minister's office at 10 Downing Street and, most likely, at the office of the Minister for Magic at the Ministry of Magic. It is highly probable that a Permanent Sticking Charm was placed on it, as the Muggle Prime Minister could never get the portrait off his wall, even with a builder to help. It served as a messenger between the Minister for Magic and the Muggle Prime Minister.[3] There was also a portrait of Ulick Gamp at the Leaky Cauldron,[4] presumably as an honour for ensuring protection of the pub as a safe haven for wizards.[7] After a mountain troll that had been kept in Percival Shacklehorn's charmed tent escaped and smashed much of the pub, the bartender mistakenly hit the portrait with a Confundus Charm. The charred painting was subsequently retrieved and restored during the Ministry investigation that followed the disturbance, by Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner.[4]  Physical appearance Gamp was described as "little", "froglike" and wore purple robes and a silver curly wig.[3]  Etymology Ulick is the Anglicised form of the Irish names Uilleac and Uilleag. There have been several Irish politicians and noblemen named Ulick.  Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 5 images related to Ulick Gamp.
