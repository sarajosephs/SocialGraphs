G. McGonagall (possibly)    Affiliation  Loyalty McGonagall family   [Source]  Malcolm McGonagall was a Scottish half-blood wizard who was the second child and first son of the Muggle Robert McGonagall and witch Isobel Ross.[1]  Biography Malcolm revealed his magical ability at an early age. His mother and his older sister Minerva worked together to teach him and his younger brother, Robert Jnr, that they could not go about showing off their magic. They also worked to conceal the "accidents and embarrassments" that the two boys' magic sometimes caused from their father.[1] Malcolm eventually fathered at least one child. His offspring would often visit his sister's home in Hogsmeade during her brief marriage between 1981 and 1984.[1]  Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Writing by J.
