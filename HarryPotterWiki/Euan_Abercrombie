As he was first in his year alphabetically, he was the first to be sorted, and was sorted into Gryffindor House.[2] He was a small boy with prominent ears, who often looked terrified.[2] He appeared to believe in the Daily Prophet's smear campaign against Harry Potter, as he looked at him fearfully when Harry tried to smile at him.[2]  Etymology "Abercrombie" is a surname of Celtic or Gaelic origin. It comes from the name of a parish in Fife, Scotland, on the northern shore of the Firth of Forth, whence the possessor took his surname; from Aber, marshy ground, a place where two or more streams meet; and cruime or crombie, a bend or crook. Aber, in the Celtic and Gaelic, and also in the Cornish British, signifies the confluence of two or more streams, or the mouth of a river, where it flows into the sea; hence it is often applied to marshy ground, generally near the confluence of two rivers. It also signifies, sometimes, a gulf or whirlpool. "Euan" is of Scottish and Gaelic origin, and it means "born of yew" or "youth". It also means "little swift one" in Irish Gaelic.
