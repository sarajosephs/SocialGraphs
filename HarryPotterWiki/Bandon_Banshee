Hagrid also correctly suspected then that Lockhart was indeed a dishonest con artist, as he stated afterwards that "If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle."[3]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (First mentioned) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) (Mentioned only) Pottermore (First appearance) (Seen on book cover) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 6 (Gilderoy Lockhart)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 16 (The Chamber of Secrets)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Chapter 7 (Mudbloods And Murmurs)              Categories         Categories:   Banshees    Females             Languages      Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
