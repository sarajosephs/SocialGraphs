In a twist of irony, he died when a Defensive Charm backfired and his roof caved in. For this reason, he was immortalised on a Chocolate Frog Card.[1][2]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology The name "Fulbert" is from the Germanic elements folk "people" and beraht "bright". Saint Fulbert was an 11th-century bishop of Chartres.  Behind the scenes  "It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default." — J. K. Rowling's Harvard Commencement Speech in 2008[3]  It appears that Fulbert the Fearful embodies J.K. Rowling's personal belief that living an excessively cautious life is hardly a life at all, and doing so will just makes you lose. She expressed this during her Commencement Speech at Harvard University in 2008. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 5 images related to Fulbert the Fearful.
