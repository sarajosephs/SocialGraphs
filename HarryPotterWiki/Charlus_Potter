He married Dorea Black and together they had a son. Charlus was the uncle by marriage of Alphard, Cygnus and Walburga Black, thus he is the great-uncle of Sirius Black III and Regulus Black II, as well as Bellatrix Lestrange, Andromeda Tonks and Narcissa Malfoy. As well as this, Charlus is the great-great uncle of Draco Malfoy and Nymphadora Tonks and the great-great-great uncle of Scorpius Malfoy and Ted Lupin. Also, he is related in some way to James Potter and his son, the famous Harry Potter.  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology Charlus could refer back to the name Charles. It is derived from the Germanic karl or hari. It can mean "man", "army" or "warrior". This can relate to many members of the Potter family. Potter is a very common surname of English origin. It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. Beatrix Potter was a well-known English children's author. Potter's field is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans. The Potter family had many members that fit that description. The Potter Box is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University. J. K. Rowling has also commented that she has liked the name since childhood, as a family that had lived near her carried this surname.[4] Behind the scenes There was some speculation that Charlus Potter was the father of James Potter and the paternal grandfather of Harry Potter. Later,  Pottermore has revealed that Fleamont Potter, not Charlus, is Harry's grandfather. Either way, Charlus was indeed related to James, being most likely an uncle or cousin of him. He may also have been a descendant of Abraham Potter. Charlus was not featured on the Potter family tree on Pottermore, but he was featured on the Black family tree. Notably, Charlus was not the only Potter not featured in the family tree launched on the platform, as Ralston Potter and Abraham Potter are also not on the tree. J. K. Rowling has stated that Harry had no family remaining other than the Dursleys at the time of Lord Voldemort's attack on Godric's Hollow, suggesting that Charlus, and any descendants he might have had otherwise, were dead by this time. However, this is not fully confirmed, and it is not known exactly what happened to them, so there is a small possibility that Charlus and or his descendants were still alive during the events of the saga. Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film) (Appears on Black family tree tapestry) Notes and references   ↑ Petunia, as said by Dumbledore, is "the only family [Harry Potter] has left", implying that Charlus is possibly dead by 31st October 1981.  ↑ Since Dorea Black was not disowned by her family (who believed strongly in the importance of blood purity), it can be assumed that Charlus was a respectable pure-blood wizard it was also stated that the Potters were a pure-blood family, until the birth of Harry Potter.  ↑ Since Dorea Black was not disowned by her family (who believed strongly in the importance of blood purity), it can be assumed that Charlus was a respectable pure-blood wizard it was also stated that the Potters were a pure-blood family, until the birth of Harry Potter.  ↑ Barnes and Noble interview, March 19, 1999              Categories         Categories:   20th century deaths    British individuals    House of Black    Males    Married individuals    Parents    Peverell family descendants    Potter family    Pure-bloods    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Italiano Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
