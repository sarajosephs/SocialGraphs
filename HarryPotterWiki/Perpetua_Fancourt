Most of the greatest wizarding inventors and innovators were in our house, including Perpetua Fancourt, the inventor of the lunascope […]." — Robert Hilliard.[src] Perpetua Fancourt was born in 1900,[3] somewhere in the British Isles. In her youth, she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from around 1911 to 1918, where she was sorted into Ravenclaw.[2]  Adulthood    A younger Perpetua Fancourt    "It's a lunascope, old boy — no more messing around with moon charts, see?" — A diner at the Leaky Cauldron in 1993.[src]  After her graduation from Hogwarts School, Ms. Fancourt studied further into Astronomy, becoming an accomplished and celebrated Astronomer. Perhaps in an attempt to further the study of her area of expertise, she invented an optical device to counter the difficulty of working with moon charts, which she named lunascope.[3] Ms. Fancourt must have created it at a fairly young age, as by 1926 they were available to own.  Death and post-mortem Ms. Fancourt died in 1991, aged around 91. In her honour, her achievement, the invention of the lunascope, was recorded on a Chocolate Frog Card.[3] On 1 September, 1991, Prefect Robert Hilliard welcomed the Ravenclaw first years to Ravenclaw Tower with a short speech in which he mentioned inventor Perpetua Fancourt as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been sorted, like them, into Ravenclaw.[2]  Magical abilities and skills Astronomy: Fancourt was a celebrated and highly accomplished professional Astronomer with much knowledge of this branch of both magic and science. She specialised in the study of moons, and even invented her own Astronomical device, the Lunascope, to help overcome the difficulty of Moon charts, a very impressive achievement in the field which gained her recognition on a Chocolate Frog Card. Etymology The name "Perpetua" is derived from Latin perpetuus meaning "continuous".  Behind the scenes Based on her year of birth, she would have been three or four years below Newt Scamander, who owned one of her Lunascopes, during their school years at Hogwarts, though it is unknown if they knew each other.
