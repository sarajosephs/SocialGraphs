Morrigan was an ancestor of William Sayre, who nicknamed his daughter, Isolt, "Morrigan" due to her affinity for all things natural when she was young.[1]  Contents  1 Magical skills and abilities 2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Magical skills and abilities Transfiguration: Morrigan was exceptionally proficient with the art of Human Transfiguration, that she learned how to become an Animagus, allowing her to transform into a crow at will.[1] Potions: In order to fully become an Animagus, one must brew the highly advanced, difficult and time-consuming Animagus potion to complete the process,[4] meaning she was very talented in this magical field as well. Etymology According to Irish mythology, the Morrígan ("phantom queen") or Mórrígan (moe-ree-gan) ("great queen") was a figure associated with fate, especially with foretelling doom and death in battle — in this capacity, she would take the shape of a crow, flying above the battlefield.[5]  Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.12 1.13 1.14 1.15 1.16 1.17 1.18 Writing by J.
