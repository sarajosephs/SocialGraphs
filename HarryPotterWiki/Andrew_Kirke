Contents  1 Biography 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography Andrew became a Beater on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, along with Jack Sloper, in 1995. They took over the positions after Fred and George Weasley, who were given a lifelong ban from Quidditch by Dolores Umbridge (their bans were lifted right after Umbridge was removed from Hogwarts). Angelina Johnson, the team Captain, was unimpressed by Andrew and Jack's performances during try-outs, but considered them to be better than the others who had tried out. Ron Weasley considered them to be dreadful players, even worse than he was.[3] During Gryffindor's quick defeat to Hufflepuff, Andrew had a pitiful performance; when Zacharias Smith flew in his direction carrying the Quaffle, Andrew shrieked and fell off his broomstick. Ginny Weasley caught the Golden Snitch twenty-two minutes into the match, causing Gryffindor to lose by only ten points.[4] Later, after the match with Ravenclaw, he and his teammates victoriously carried Ron.[5]  Behind the scenes Andrew Kirke's name is possibly derived from The Chronicles of Narnia book The Magician's Nephew, which features a main character named Digory Kirke with a maternal uncle named Andrew Ketterley. This is the same namesake of fellow Quidditch player Cedric Diggory.
