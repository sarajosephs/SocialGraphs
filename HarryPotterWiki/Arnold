This article is about Ginny Weasley's pet Pygmy Puff. You may be looking for a person with the same name or the Weasleys' Puffskein.        Arnold  Biographical information  Born c. 1996    Physical information  Species Pygmy Puff[1]   Gender Male   Hair colour Purple[1]    Family information  Family members Ginny Weasley (owner)[1]Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes (breeder)[2]    Affiliation  Loyalty Ginny Weasley   [Source]    "... he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels... his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold..." — Arnold as Ginny Weasley's pet[src]  Arnold[1] was Ginny Weasley's purple Pygmy Puff,[1] or miniature Puffskein.[2]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Arnold was purchased from Ginny's brothers Fred and George Weasley at their shop in August of 1996.[2] Arnold was transported in a cage during the car ride from The Burrow to King's Cross Station on 1 September 1996.[1] In the Gryffindor common room in Hogwarts he was seen playing with Ginny[3] or riding her shoulder.[4] It is likely that he was taken with the Weasleys when the family went into hiding in the spring of 1998.  Etymology Ginny's father, Arthur Weasley, was mistakenly called "Arnold Weasley" in a 1994 Daily Prophet article written by Rita Skeeter. "Arnold" is also an anagram of "Ronald", a possible reference to Ginny's older brother.  Behind the scenes In the novel he is purple, but in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, he is pink. In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 Ginny has Arnold already in 1995 and the player can use him in the levels. According to the Hogwarts supply list, students are allowed to take an owl, a cat, or a toad to Hogwarts. However, it seems that Ginny was allowed to take her pygmy puff like her brother was able to bring his rat. Funko's Mystery Mini: Harry Potter S2 will feature the film version of Arnold has an exclusivity sold at Barnes & Noble only.[5] Appearances Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (First appearance) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) Pottermore Wizarding World LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 J.

Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary. “There you go,” said Fred proudly […] “What are those?” She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks. “Pygmy Puffs,” said George. “Miniature puffskeins, we can’t breed them fast enough.“ […] Ginny, putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. “They’re really cute!” “They’re fairly cuddly, yes,” conceded Fred. […] “Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?” said Ginny at once. “A what?” said Mrs Weasley warily. “Look, they’re so sweet. . . .” Mrs Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs […] Mrs Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs."  ↑ Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 11 (Hermione's Helping Hand) - “...Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while...”  ↑ Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 14 (Felix Felicis) - "As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels […] Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold."  ↑ https://funko.com/blogs/news/coming-soon-harry-potter-mystery-minis-supercute-plushies              Categories         Categories:   Ginevra Weasley's possessions    Males    Puffskeins    Weasley family pets             Languages      Deutsch Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
