She asked whether giving the wizard a love potion could help resolve her dilemma. Her letter was answered by Grizel Hurtz, who advised her to start using Hate Potions instead, as this would be preferable to having to constantly "doctor" her beloved's drinks.[1]  Appearances Daily Prophet Newsletters (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 Daily Prophet Newsletters, Issue 3 (see this entry on the Harry Potter Lexicon)              Categories         Categories:   British individuals    Females    Unmarried individuals    Wizards           *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
