Hagrid stood at eleven feet, six inches tall.[5] Hagrid attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1940 and was sorted into Gryffindor house. In Hagrid's third year, he was framed by Tom Riddle for the crime of opening the Chamber of Secrets and using his pet Acromantula to attack several Muggle-born students and eventually killing one of them. Though Hagrid's wand was snapped and he was expelled, he was trained as gamekeeper of Hogwarts and allowed to live on the school grounds at the request of Albus Dumbledore. In 1991, Hagrid was given the task of reintroducing Harry Potter to the wizarding world. In 1993, Hagrid would assume the post of Care of Magical Creatures professor after the retirement of Professor Silvanus Kettleburn. As a member of both the original and the re-instated Order of the Phoenix, Hagrid fought in several battles of the First and the Second Wizarding Wars, including the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.  It can be assumed that Hagrid kept in contact with the trio after the war. By 2017 he was still living, and presumably still teaching and tending to his gamekeeping duties at Hogwarts. When Harry's son, Albus Severus, started school he invited him for tea, just as Hagrid had done for his father and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

Tiny little bloke, my dad was. By the time I was six I could lift him up an' put him on top o' the dresser if he annoyed me. Used ter make him laugh..." — Hagrid telling Olympe Maxime about his father[src]      Hagrid and his father   Hagrid was born on 6 December 1928 to Mr Hagrid, a wizard, and Fridwulfa, a giantess, and grew up in the West Country of England, near the Forest of Dean, where he acquired his distinctive accent.[13][14] When Hagrid was about three, his mother returned to her Giant colony, leaving his father to raise him alone. Hagrid said he had very few memories of his mother from his childhood, but remembered his father fondly; as a half-giant, he overtook his father in size by the age of six, and amused the "tiny" wizard by picking him up and setting him on top of a dresser when Hagrid was annoyed with him. Later, when talking to Harry, Ron, and Hermione about the death of his mother, Hagrid admitted that she was not a great mother at all.[15] He grew to an height of eleven and a half feet tall, immense by human standards but very small by giant standards.  Hogwarts years (1940-1943)  Tom Riddle: "Evening, Rubeus." Rubeus Hagrid: "What yer doin' down here, Tom?" Tom Riddle: "It's all over. I'm going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They're talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don't stop." Rubeus Hagrid: "‘N at d'yeh —" Tom Riddle: "I don't think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don't make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and —" Rubeus Hagrid: "It never killed no one!" Tom Riddle: "Come on, Rubeus. The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered…" Rubeus Hagrid: "It wasn't him! He wouldn'! He never!" — Tom Riddle framing Hagrid for having opened the Chamber of Secrets[src]  Hagrid's father was thrilled when his son was accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Hagrid began his education in 1940 in which he was Sorted into Gryffindor House.[10] During his third year, Hagrid acquired one in what would be a long line of dangerous pets: a young Acromantula which he named Aragog.       Riddle finding Rubeus Hagrid keeping a young Aragog in the school dungeons, in 1943   That same year, fifth-year student Tom Marvolo Riddle, who would go on to become Lord Voldemort, opened the Chamber of Secrets and unleashed another monster, which Riddle used to attack and petrify a number of Muggle-born students until he finally caused the death of a girl named Myrtle Warren. When the school was threatened with closing, a consequence highly undesired by Riddle, the boy found out about Aragog and turned Hagrid in as the culprit. It likely didn't help that Hagrid had a habit of getting into trouble every other week; he'd once tried raising werewolf cubs under his bed and was known to sneak off into the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls (both of these statements were likely exaggerations on Riddle's part however). Hagrid protected Aragog and helped him flee to the Forbidden Forest; however, he was shortly thereafter expelled from Hogwarts,[16] a fate that he was relieved that his father never knew of, having died during Hagrid's second year.[17]      Hagrid taking new first years to Hogwarts.   Following his expulsion, the Ministry of Magic forbade Hagrid from practising magic and destroyed his wand. The then-Transfiguration teacher Albus Dumbledore, who was convinced that Hagrid was innocent, nonetheless convinced then-Headmaster Armando Dippet to have Hagrid trained for the job of Gamekeeper and allow the orphan to remain a resident of the school. Hagrid continued to do magic using his pink umbrella, which most likely contained the broken fragments of his wand, with varying degree of success. At some point after he came of age in 1945, Hagrid was entrusted the responsibility of helping out with the security of the school when he was named the school's Keeper of the Keys, in which capacity he was tasked with, among other things, opening the Entrance Gates to let visitors in and out of the school grounds and escorting new students to the castle for their first-ever arrival at Hogwarts school.[18] At some point following the graduation of Molly Weasley around 1968, Ogg retired or otherwise left the position, and Hagrid officially succeeded him in the role as gamekeeper of the school and took over his duties full-time.    First Wizarding War (1970-1981)  "No, sir — house was almost destroyed but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol." — Hagrid to Dumbledore on rescuing young Harry Potter in 1981[src]      Hagrid as a member of the original Order   Sometime in the 1970s, Hagrid joined the original Order of the Phoenix. It was a secret organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore to oppose Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The Order was constructed after Voldemort returned to England from abroad and started his campaign to take over the Ministry of Magic and persecute Muggles and Muggle-borns.  Voldemort's first reign of terror lasted years and turned friends against each other. It was said that during this time it was difficult to trust one another, as you did not know for sure who had gone over to the dark side, partly due to the Death Eaters' access to the Imperius Curse. The Order worked with the Ministry to oppose the Dark Lord and his followers, even allowing Aurors the use of Unforgivable Curses. Voldemort also had a number of magical dark creatures under his command as well, such as giants.      Hagrid delivering Harry Potter to 4 Privet Drive   At the abrupt end of the First Wizarding War, Albus Dumbledore sent Hagrid to rescue a one-year-old Harry Potter from the ruins of his house in Godric's Hollow, after Lord Voldemort murdered both James and Lily Potter in 1981. Using Sirius Black's motorcycle, he brought Harry Potter to Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, who were waiting to deliver the boy to his only remaining family — Lily's Muggle elder sister, Petunia, and her husband Vernon Dursley. Hagrid was very sad at the thought of James and Lily Potter being dead.[19]  Between the wars (1981-1995)  Unidentified seventh-year: "Hagrid has saved my life on more than one occasion." Unidentified first-year: "Hagrid was the first person to welcome me to Hogwarts." — Unidentified students reminiscing on Hagrid's actions[src]  Meeting Jacob's sibling     'Engorgio!' It is requested that this article, or a section of this article, should be expanded - Needs significant expansion of his HM story, there is very little here. Please help the Harry Potter Wiki by expanding this article to give more complete coverage of its subject.    "I've come to accept the fact that Hagrid will never stop yelling." — Professor Snape on Hagrid's cheerful mood at his birthday party[src]  Early in the 1984–1985 school year, Hagrid rescued Jacob's sibling from Devil's Snare.[20] He also met Ben Copper.[21] Around this time, he also got a puppy, which he later named Fang.[22] Shortly before one of his birthdays, Hagrid lost one of his pets and stopped being as cheerful as he usually was.[21] Around this time, Dumbledore recruited Jacob's sibling to help throw him a huge birthday party to cheer him up and show just how much everyone appreciated him. At some point before this, he saved a seventh-year's life, made a first-year feel welcome at Hogwarts, and baked rock cakes to cheer up a third-year.[23] During the 1986 summer holidays, he bred an excess amount of Flobberworms in his hut, which he was unsure what to do with. He informed Jacob's sibling of this at the start of the 1986–1987 school year, before they asked him about Boggarts on the school grounds. He told them Boggarts had not been seen at Hogwarts since Jacob's school days.[24] During the 1987–1988 school year, Hagrid's hut became infested with Bundimuns. Jacob's sibling helped Hagrid clear out the infestation with the Scouring Charm, for which Hagrid was extremely grateful.[25]      Hagrid hospitalised in St Mungo's   In the 1990–1991 school year, Hagrid was bitten by an Acromantula from the Forbidden Forest and had to receive treatment in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. As part of their seventh-year career assignments at the hospital, Jacob's sibling and Penny Haywood attended to his bedside. They even brought him a Pumpkin Pasty to eat.[26]  Meeting Harry Potter  Hagrid: "If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him. Stop Lily an' James Potter's son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled—" Vernon Dursley: "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" Hagrid: "NEVER-INSULT-ALBUS-DUMBLEDORE-IN-FRONT-OF-ME!" — Hagrid threatening Vernon Dursley[src]      Hagrid giving Harry a birthday cake   After Harry was accepted to Hogwarts in 1991, Hagrid was given the task of finding Harry, as Harry's uncle Vernon was doing everything in his power to prevent his nephew from receiving his Hogwarts acceptance letter. On Harry's eleventh birthday, Hagrid found the Dursleys and Harry in an isolated Hut-on-the-Rock, and accidentally broke the door down from the force of his knocking. Vernon threatened him with a gun, only for Hagrid to contemptuously seize the gun and twist it into a knot. Hagrid gave Harry a birthday cake and revealed to Harry that he was a wizard, and several times came close to losing his temper at Vernon due to repeated insults, but lost it entirely when Vernon called Albus Dumbledore, a "crackpot old fool". In retaliation, Hagrid attempted to turn Harry's spoiled cousin, Dudley, into a pig, but only managed to give the boy a pig's tail. Hagrid credited this to Dudley being "so much like a pig already, there was not much left to do".      Harry and Hagrid visit Diagon Alley in search of school supplies   Once it was confirmed that Harry would be attending Hogwarts, after Hagrid decidedly ignored the Dursleys' protests, he helped Harry find his bearings in the magical world by taking him to Diagon Alley, through the Leaky Cauldron, to buy his school necessities. While in Diagon Alley, Hagrid took Harry to Gringotts Wizarding Bank to withdraw some funds from the Potters' vault, and to retrieve the Philosopher's Stone from high-security Vault 713, to be transported to Hogwarts for even safer keeping. Hagrid also bought Hedwig, a snowy white owl, for Harry's eleventh birthday. He comforted Harry about his upcoming attendance at Hogwarts school and provided him with a ticket detailing the date, time and place that he would need to catch the Hogwarts Express.  Protecting the Philosopher's Stone  "Now, listen to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel —" — Hagrid trying to convince the trio to stop nosing in about the Philosopher's Stone[src]      Hagrid and the stranger at the Hog's Head   When news got out that Vault 713 had been broken into (shortly after it had been emptied by Hagrid), Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger quickly realised that whatever Hagrid had moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts was being hidden in the off-limits third-floor corridor and guarded by a massive three-headed dog. Hagrid refused to disclose what the vault had contained, but he mentioned that the secret was "between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel".  In the spring of 1992, Hagrid met a hooded man (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) at the Hog's Head and was enticed to play a game of cards when the mysterious person bet a dragon egg. Assuming the man was a dragon dealer and fellow dangerous creature enthusiast, and under the influence of a fair amount of mead, Hagrid was convinced to divulge details about Fluffy, the three-headed dog Hagrid had lent to Dumbledore to help guard the Philosopher's Stone.      The dragon egg preparing to hatch   Harry, knowing that Hagrid had always wanted a dragon and thinking it far too much a coincidence that a man just happened to bring a rare dragon egg to the local pub, questioned Hagrid alongside Ron and Hermione about what had exactly happened during the card game. This time, Hagrid let slip to the trio what he had told the hooded man: the secret to calming Fluffy was that one simply had to play music and Fluffy would fall asleep. This allowed the trio to pursue the potential thief. Once the dragon egg hatched, Hagrid lovingly named the hatchling Norbert. Hagrid was initially blind to the chaos that the hatchling caused, but eventually, Harry, Ron, and Hermione convinced him to allow Norbert to be taken to a dragon sanctuary by friends of Ron's brother, Charlie, who worked with dragons. After learning that Voldemort had attempted to steal the Stone using the information Hagrid gave him while drunk, Hagrid was distraught with guilt, but Harry assured Hagrid that he did not blame him. As an apology, Hagrid spent the time that Harry was unconscious sending off owls to some of his parents' old school friends, assembling an album full of wizarding photos of Harry's parents for him.  Imprisonment in Azkaban  "If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd have ter do would be ter follow the spiders. That'd lead 'em right. That's all I'm sayin'." — Hagrid cryptically telling Harry and Ron how to uncover the truth[src]      Fudge visiting Hagrid in his hut in order to take him to Azkaban   During the 1992–1993 school year, Hagrid showed public disdain for the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart, although he never did so for any other teachers. In 1993 Hagrid was sent to the wizarding prison, Azkaban, when the Chamber of Secrets was re-opened. It was assumed he was the one who reopened the Chamber because his expulsion from Hogwarts was for the same occurrence. Even with Dumbledore backing Hagrid, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge insisted on taking Hagrid anyway. So on the same night Dumbledore was asked to step down as Headmaster by the school governors, Hagrid was escorted to Azkaban. However, he was able to help Harry and Ron solve the mystery surrounding the Chamber, by advising them to "follow the spiders."   "Follow the spiders. I'll never forgive Hagrid. We're lucky to be alive." — Ron's anger at Hagrid's suggestion[src]      Hagrid during his short stint in Azkaban   Following the spiders led the boys to Aragog, the Acromantula believed to have attacked students during the 1942-1943 school year, and his family. Though Harry and Ron barely escaped the encounter with their lives, they managed to obtain some valuable information over the course of their conversation with Aragog: the monster within the Chamber had nothing to do with Hagrid, and the girl it had killed in the 1940s had died in a bathroom. Harry was thus able to find the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, slay the basilisk within, and destroy Tom Riddle's diary.  As it turned out, the actual perpetrator had been the person who had turned Hagrid in in 1943. Hagrid was exonerated and released from Azkaban. He returned to Hogwarts at three o'clock in the morning and joined in the ongoing celebration of the closure of what had been a terrifying incident, accidentally knocking Harry and Ron face-first into their plates of trifle when he cuffed them on the shoulders.[16]  Protecting Buckbeak  "S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in black robes an' I kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them dates yeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an' said his bit, and the Committee jus' did exac'ly what he told 'em...." — Hagrid lamenting over his defence at Buckbeak's trial[src]      Hagrid's first Care of Magical Creatures lesson   In the 1993–1994 school year, Hagrid became a professor of the Care of Magical Creatures. For his first lesson, Hagrid taught his third-year students about hippogriffs. After explaining the proper way to greet a hippogriff and choosing Harry to demonstrate, Draco Malfoy caused trouble by insulting the hippogriff Buckbeak, even though Hagrid had just warned the class to treat the creatures with respect. Buckbeak attacked Draco, and the Ministry of Magic issued an order for Buckbeak's execution after a hearing in which Lucius Malfoy's pull at the Ministry was demonstrated, the incident also damaging Hagrid's self-confidence; later lessons focused on tamer creatures like flobberworms. Buckbeak's attack on Malfoy was later used during the Triwizard Tournament by Rita Skeeter to give Hagrid a very bad reputation.       The night of Buckbeak's intended execution   An appeal took place on 6 June 1994, but this was to no avail, and Buckbeak was to be executed at sunset that night. Before the execution, Harry, Ron, and Hermione visited Hagrid to console him, and they left just before the executioner arrived. Knowing Buckbeak's position, and the exact timing of the start of the execution, Harry and Hermione were able to save Buckbeak by going back in time with Hermione's Time-Turner, allowing them to rescue Buckbeak after the Ministry team sent to execute him had confirmed his location while Hagrid and Dumbledore were under observation, thus guaranteeing that neither would be blamed for Buckbeak's rescue/escape.[27] Delighted at the escape of his beloved pet, Hagrid spent the whole night celebrating with a large bottle of what may have been Firewhisky.  Triwizard Tournament  "'Ow dare you! I 'ave nevair been more insulted in my life! 'Alf-giant? Moi? I 'ave —  I 'ave big bones!" — Madame Maxime's words leaving Hagrid heartbroken[src]      Hagrid teaching his fourth-year Care of Magical Creatures class   During the 1994–1995 school year, the Triwizard Tournament was held at Hogwarts. Students from the Durmstrang Institute and the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic attended Hogwarts starting in October, and Hagrid was tasked with taking care of the Beauxbatons' Abraxans, which drank only single malt whiskey and required forceful handling. Over the course of the year, he performed various tasks essential to the workings of the tournament: in November, he helped Charles Weasley take care of the dragons used in the First Task of the tournament, which he showed Harry at the suggestion of Professor Moody (who was really Barty Crouch Jnr); he also bred Blast-Ended Skrewts as a project for his fourth years, which were to be used in the Third task of the tournament.[28]      Hagrid at the Yule ball dancing with Madam Maxime   Throughout the year, Hagrid and Olympe Maxime, the half-giantess headmistress of Beauxbatons, had a budding romantic relationship, which included dancing during the Yule Ball. Hagrid confided in her his life story, revealing to her that he is a half-giant, assuming her to be one as well because of her massive size. She was offended by the insinuations that she was part giant, and left him heartbroken.[28] Rita Skeeter, in her Animagus beetle form, overheard Hagrid's confession and reported it in the Daily Prophet. After receiving a fair amount of hate mail, Hagrid hid in the seclusion of his hut, while Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank temporarily took over Care of Magical Creatures, and attempted to resign from his position as Professor. Dumbledore refused to accept Hagrid's resignation, and he was eventually convinced to come back and teach by Harry, Ron, and Hermione.[28]      Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest with Ron and Hermione   Before the events of the third task, Hagrid was called by Dumbledore to escort Harry back to the castle after he and Viktor Krum encountered Barty Crouch Snr at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. When it appeared that Krum had been attacked by Crouch (really it was his son hiding in the trees), Igor Karkaroff accused Dumbledore of treachery and spat at his foot. This caused Hagrid to lose his temper with Karkaroff and pin him to a tree, demanding an apology. He was talked down by Dumbledore, and saw Harry back to his common room, reprimanding him for being in such a situation and warning him against the foreign students.[28] Following the return of Lord Voldemort, Hagrid attempted to comfort Harry after his ordeal and admitted that he had believed Voldemort would have returned eventually, echoing something he had told Harry at their first meeting; that Voldemort did not have enough humanity left to die. He admitted to Harry and his friends that he and Madam Maxime had important business to attend to over the holidays but refused to say more. He also imparted some wisdom to Harry, helping him accept that what would come would come.[28]  Second Wizarding War (1995-1998) Mission to the giant colony  "Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow. Let'em see we kept our promises. We'll come back tomorrow with another present, an' then we do come back with another present — gives a good impression, see? An' gives them time ter test out the firs' present an' find out it's a good one, an' get 'em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus — overload 'em with information an' they'll kill yeh jus' to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an' went off an' found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in, an' the followin' mornin' we went back an' this time we found Karkus sittin' up waitin' fer us lookin' all eager." — Hagrid talking to Harry, Ron, and Hermione about his mission to try and appease the giants[src]      Hagrid and Madam Maxime on their shared mission   When Albus Dumbledore learned of Voldemort's rebirth, he sent Hagrid and Madame Maxime as envoys to the giant colonies of north-eastern Minsk, in the hopes of dissuading the giants from joining Lord Voldemort's side in the coming war. Bearing gifts of eternal Gubraithian Fire and a goblin-made battle helmet, they eventually won over the Gurg, Karkus. However, two Death Eaters that Voldemort had sent on the same mission engineered an uprising. This uprising was led by the giant Golgomath, who beheaded Karkus and usurped his position. Golgomath then ordered his subordinates to attack Hagrid and Maxime and forced them to flee. Golgomath was far more keen towards the Death Eaters and got on well with Walden Macnair, both of whom enjoyed killing and had shared a dislike toward Hagrid.  Hagrid subsequently found that his mother had died years ago, and the existence of his half-brother Grawp, who was having a hard time within his colony as he was considerably smaller than most giants. Hagrid insisted on bringing Grawp back to Hogwarts due to this and presumably to prevent Grawp from being enslaved by Voldemort alongside the other giants. Grawp, however, was highly resistant to the idea and had a general tendency to be violent. Thus Hagrid and Grawp made the journey back to Scotland separately from Madam Maxime.[17]  Living with Grawp  "Hermione, I couldn't leave him. See — he's my brother!" — Hagrid explaining his decision to bring an undersized giant back to Hogwarts[src]      Umbridge interrogating Hagrid about his long absence   About halfway through the school year, Hagrid returned from his mission for Dumbledore with his half-brother, Grawp. In 1995, Dolores Umbridge was brought in as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and later became the first and only Hogwarts High Inquisitor. Hagrid barely excused himself for his long absence from Umbridge's tyrannical questioning and was surprised that he would be subjected to her inspection soon afterwards.      Hagrid telling Harry, Ron, and Hermione of his negotiations with the giants   Hagrid resumed his teaching post, beginning with a lesson about Thestrals. Despite their rather off-putting appearance and the inability of most of the class to see them, Hermione found these lessons far more useful than Hagrid's typical classes. Regardless, early in 1996, Professor Umbridge put Hagrid on probation after supposedly finding his lessons unsatisfactory by her standards, despite Hermione's every effort to make sure Hagrid's curriculum was geared toward preparing students for the upcoming O.W.L.s. Umbridge's harsh judgement was largely due to her distaste for "half-breeds," and it was only the resistance she met from Headmaster Dumbledore that kept her from firing Hagrid altogether. When confronted by the trio about this revelation, Hagrid attempted to make light of it (nearly concussing Professor Vector with his fist as she went past) but was consistently jumpy and nervous at the prospect of being sacked.      Hagrid introducing Grawp, his half-brother, to Harry and Hermione   However, once Dumbledore was forced to leave in order to shield Harry from punishment for establishing Dumbledore's Army, Hagrid feared that he would be driven out by the new Headmistress Umbridge. In preparation for this, he introduced Harry and Hermione to Grawp. Grawp took an immediate liking to Hermione, whom he called "Hermy," and Hagrid asked the two of them, along with Ron, to take care of Grawp in his absence. Upon Dumbledore's departure, general chaos reigned within the school, as the students became determined to make Umbridge's job as hard for her as possible; Lee Jordan even released a couple of nifflers into her office, for which she blamed Hagrid. Umbridge finally attempted to have Hagrid forcibly removed from the premises, and possibly arrested, when she brought several Ministry officials to his hut in the middle of the night so as not to cause a commotion with the students due to their earlier presence at Sybill Trelawney's dismissal. Hagrid refused to go quietly and took on the officials, whose attempts to Stun him proved fruitless thanks to his giant blood. Fang came to his master's aid until one of the wizards Stunned him, prompting Hagrid to lift the culprit bodily from the ground and throw the unfortunate soul ten feet away.      Hagrid visiting a wheelchair-bound McGonagall   While all of this was being witnessed by the trio's Astronomy exam, Professor Minerva McGonagall came charging out of the castle demanding that Hagrid be left alone and, in a disgustingly cowardly move by the officials, was seriously injured after being hit by four simultaneous Stunning Spells without warning. Enraged at this dishonourable conduct and the injury of his friend and colleague, Hagrid knocked out two more of his assailants before fleeing with his unconscious dog. Aurors were sent to search for Hagrid, but he successfully evaded capture by hiding in the same cave that had previously proved a useful hiding place for Sirius Black. Once Dumbledore was reinstated as the Headmaster of Hogwarts and Umbridge permanently removed from the school, Hagrid was welcomed back to his post.[17]  Aragog's funeral  "It's... him... It's... Aragog... I think he's dyin'... He got ill over the summer an' he's not gettin' better... I don' know what I'll do if he... if he... We've bin tergether so long..." — Hagrid regarding a dying Aragog[src]  Hagrid accompanied the trio and some members of the Weasley family to Diagon Alley as security for Harry, as these were dark and dangerous times. When Hagrid found out that none of his sixth-year Gryffindor students chose to continue past their O.W.L. level of Care of Magical Creatures, he initially misinterpreted this as a reflection of his students not liking him, as opposed to his questionable teaching.[29] Hagrid eventually came to forgive Harry, Ron, and Hermione, understanding that their N.E.W.T. classes were difficult with massive work loads (and after Hermione confirmed that they could not have managed his classes with Time-Turners, as they had all been smashed during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries); his anger abated completely when he was overcome with worry about the failing health of Aragog.[29]      Hagrid at Aragog's funeral with Harry and Professor Slughorn   When Aragog died in 1997, he asked Harry, Ron and Hermione to help him bury the dead Acromantula's body, though the heightened security around the castle with Voldemort's confirmed return made that difficult. Ultimately, spurred on by Felix Felicis, Harry went to Hagrid's anyway and met Professor Horace Slughorn on the way. Hagrid, along with Harry and Professor Slughorn, buried Aragog near the pumpkin patch, and then gave him a tearful salute involving a good deal of mead. Harry used the situation to his advantage in retrieving a memory of Tom Riddle asking about Horcruxes from a very inebriated Slughorn.[29]  Battle of the Astronomy Tower Main article: Battle of the Astronomy Tower  "But what happened, Harry? I jus' saw them Death Eaters runnin down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin' with ‘em? Where's he gone — was he chasin' them?" — Hagrid's confusion after the Battle of the Astronomy Tower[src]      Hagrid and Harry attempt to put out the fire   During the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Albus Dumbledore was killed by Severus Snape (on Dumbledore's orders). Near the end of the battle, he confronted Death Eater Thorfinn Rowle who attempted to curse him only to realise that Hagrid's giant blood protected him. Rowle proceeded to set Hagrid's Hut on fire while the Death Eaters were fleeing the school grounds. Hagrid and Harry Potter, who had chased Snape out of the castle, put it out before the hut burned down.       Hagrid carrying Dumbledore's body during his funeral   Hagrid was grief-stricken about Dumbledore's death, having been one of his strongest supporters. Hagrid carried Dumbledore's body to be interred at his funeral, almost breaking down several times. Hagrid placed the body carefully upon the table. Then he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, Dolores Umbridge for example. Later Hagrid and Grawp were seen comforting one another.[29]  Battle of the Seven Potters Main article: Battle of the Seven Potters  "My job's ter get you there safe, Harry!" — Hagrid to Harry during the Battle of the Seven Potters, in response to Harry's protests that they turn around[src]      Hagrid and Harry Potter along with the others right before the sky battle   Hagrid was among the thirteen members of the Order of the Phoenix, led by Alastor Moody, that made up the Advance Guard. The Advance Guard was in charge of moving Harry Potter out of the Dursley home before his seventeenth birthday; the plan to do so included having five of Harry's friends (Ron, Hermione, Fleur Delacour, and Fred and George Weasley), as well as Mundungus Fletcher, impersonate Harry to act as decoys, with an Order of the Phoenix member protecting each of them, and fly to six safe houses before taking portkeys to the Burrow. Knowing that any Death Eaters watching out for them would assume the most skilled Auror would be moving with the real Harry, Alastor Moody took Mundungus Fletcher, while Hagrid was given the important task of protecting the real Harry in the side-car of Sirius Black's motorcycle.      Voldemort duelling against Harry Potter over Little Whinging   Arthur Weasley had helped Hagrid make several adjustments to the bike, including adding a button that produced dragon's fire, one that produced a net, and another that produced a solid wall, all of which materialised behind the bike by expanding out of its exhaust pipe. As it turned out, the Death Eaters had found out about the plan to move Harry earlier than rumoured (as the Order had purposely released false information about moving him at a later date) and the seven Harrys, with their Order protectors, were ambushed. Hagrid was able to keep the Death Eaters at bay with the help of the modifications on his bike and Harry's wand-work, but when Harry discovered one of the attacking Death Eaters was an imperiused Stanley Shunpike, he made the unusual move of using the Disarming Charm. As he had done the same unexpected thing in Little Hangleton graveyard in 1995, Harry was identified as the real deal, and Voldemort came after him personally. In the struggle that followed, the motorcycle was torn apart and Hagrid dove off the bike at a Death Eater, falling a great distance to the ground. He survived, however, as did Harry, when it turned out they had fallen into the protection surrounding the Tonks house.      Hagrid finding out Moody was killed during the Battle of the Seven Potters   Nymphadora Tonks' parents, Ted and Andromeda Tonks, healed their injuries, as Hagrid comforted Harry over the death of his beloved pet owl Hedwig, saying she had lived a "good old life". Since Hagrid had a history of having trouble keeping secrets, Fleur Delacour suspected Hagrid was the one who had unintentionally leaked the date of the intended move, although Harry refused to blame anyone even before that was revealed not to be the case. That same night, Hagrid and all the other members of the Order mourned the death of Alastor Moody, who had been targeted immediately by Voldemort, exactly as Moody anticipated.      Hagrid and Maxime attending Bill and Fleur's wedding   During the summer of 1997, Hagrid was present at Harry's seventeenth birthday party. He gave him a mokeskin pouch which held objects retrievable only by the owner. Hagrid also attended Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, accidentally sitting in the wrong spot (and destroying a number of chairs) before finding the correct place to sit.[30] During the wedding, Kingsley Shacklebolt warned the crowd that Voldemort had taken over the Ministry. It is unknown if Hagrid fought the Death Eaters that attacked the Burrow.  Hiding  "We have heard within the last few hours, that Rubeus Hagrid, well known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest in the grounds of Hogwarts, where he has rumoured to have hosted a Support Harry Potter party, in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run." — Potterwatch regarding Hagrid's escape[src]  Once back at Hogwarts, Hagrid continued his job as gatekeeper and Professor of Care of Magical Creatures. At the request of new headmaster, Severus Snape, Hagrid was placed in charge of students who had been assigned detention. Detention with Hagrid consisted of work in the Forbidden Forest, which was far safer than detention with Amycus and Alecto Carrow. Later that year, Hagrid narrowly escaped arrest after holding a Support Harry Potter party in his hut. He then went into hiding, presumably in the mountains, with his half-brother, Grawp. His escape was reported hours later on the radio programme Potterwatch.  Battle of Hogwarts  "Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave. Voice carried, didn' it? “Yeh got 'til midnight ter gimme Potter.” Knew yeh mus' be here, knew what mus' be happenin'. Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an' Grawpy an' Fang. Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin' us, Fang an' me. Told him ter let me down at the castle so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exac'ly what I meant, bu' – where's Ron an' Hermione?" — Hagrid to Harry, shortly before the start of the battle[src]      Hagrid carrying an apparently dead Harry   Hagrid returned to Hogwarts with Grawp for the final battle. He rushed out onto the grounds to prevent injury being done to the Acromantula who had swarmed out of the Forbidden Forest and were climbing up the walls of the school. He was taken captive by the Death Eaters. When Harry appeared in the forest Hagrid shouted for him to run, though was silenced by Rowle and was forced to watch as Harry sacrificed himself. After Harry's apparent death at the Dark Lord's hands, Hagrid was forced to carry his body back to the castle, sobbing and crying non-stop, devastated over the loss of Harry. As the supposed "victory party" approached the castle, Hagrid yelled at the centaurs for refusing to involve themselves in the battle and help, but he burst into tears again before he could finish his scolding.      Hagrid hugging Harry after the battle   When fighting resumed at the arrival of reinforcements, which included Buckbeak and Hagrid's herd of tame Thestrals, as well as the centaurs he had scolded earlier, Hagrid couldn't find Harry, as he used the Invisibility Cloak during the confusion. He then fought against the Death Eater Walden Macnair, presumably recognising him from both Buckbeak's trial and the mission to recruit the giants and threw him against the wall of the Great Hall, knocking him out. Hagrid was among the first to approach and congratulate Harry after Voldemort's ultimate defeat.[30] He was seen in the Great Hall among the other survivors of the battle.  Later life (1998-) The new generation  "Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday." — Harry reminding Albus on his appointment with Hagrid[src]  Hagrid continued working at Hogwarts in the 21st century. Before 31 July in 2008, he took on the role of special messenger and delivered the Hogwarts acceptance letter to a Muggle-born student in their home. He also picked them up and helped them purchase school supplies in Diagon Alley. On 1 September, he led the first-year students across the Great Lake to the Hogwarts Castle on boats as usual. During the Sorting Ceremony, he brought in Ivy Warrington, who had been distracted by the bushes outside the castle and gotten lost.[31] The next day, he picked up a copy of The Monster Book of Monsters and calmed it down after it went out of Robyn Thistlethwaite's control in the library. Robyn was frustrated at not being able to cast her spells right, so Hagrid suggested that she visit the Duelling Club. There, he watched Robyn and the aforementioned Muggle-born student practise spells against Cassandra Vole and Fischer Frey.[31]      Hagrid with students   In 2009, a group of students came to Hagrid for help with the assignment given by the visiting History of Magic professor Jakub Gorski, which was to uncover a mystery about a lost treasure within the castle. At the time, he was preparing a butter-fly pie for his half-brother Grawp, and a Swooping Evil flew out of it due to the pie not having been completed. The students helped him capture the creature and finish the pie, and Hagrid told them about a map leading to a lost family heirloom, which were often whispered about by the portraits in the halls.[31] He was still working at Hogwarts by 2017, at 89 years old, owing to the natural longevity of wizardkind, which also meant that he would likely have an extremely long life by Muggle standards. He invited Harry and Ginny's youngest son, Albus, to his hut for tea, just as he had done during Harry's first year.[30] Hagrid never married, despite his reciprocated attraction to Madame Maxime, as she was ultimately too sophisticated for them to be a good match.[2]  Helping SOS members In 2019, Hagrid led the members of the then recently established Statute of Secrecy Task Force seeking a career as Magizoologists, welcoming them by saying that he could sense they were going to sign in as he was able to see that they shared a curious spirit and ensuring them that, although being a Magizoologist was far from easy, they could succeed if they had the spirit to withstand the difficult trials and could recover. He first took them to the Diagon Alley to buy several robes and other essential pieces of equipment required to handle beasts and creatures for increased durability before proceeding to successfully teach the Stamina Charm (despite his own being "less-than-perfect"), and allowed them to help him handle several live Fire Crabs. The primary takeaway they got from this, however, was a boost in their tolerance of pain.[32] He also gave those who chose to became an Auror an elective to raise their defences against beasts.  Physical description  "A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair." — Hagrid's physical description[src]      Rubeus Hagrid   Hagrid was born to a wizard father and a giant mother, making him a half-giant. As a half-giant, Hagrid possessed great physical strength and endurance, including a resilience against some spells, though his ability to withstand spells was not as great as that of full giants. He was about twice as tall as an average man, standing at eleven feet, six inches tall[5] (too big for an ordinary-sized broomstick) and three times as wide, with a long mane of shaggy black hair and a beard that covered most of his face.  Hagrid's hands were as big as dustbin lids and his feet in their boots were like baby dolphins.[6] He had dark eyes that glinted like black beetles.[7] Hagrid's size often makes it difficult for him to enter rooms or buildings that are designed for ordinary sized people or not built with airy or grand designs, such as him not being able to fit easily into the Hospital Wing or the Burrow yet having no trouble moving in the Great Hall. He often wore an exceptionally large moleskin overcoat with several pockets that held many things, though that sometimes caused him to spend a lot of time searching for what he wanted to find. Objects within the pockets have included any number of items, such as mouldy dog biscuits, the key to Harry Potter's Gringotts vault, peppermint humbugs, a squashy package of sausages, a copper kettle, a fire poker, wizard money, a birthday cake, birthday presents, a dirty spotted handkerchief, slug pellets, and a living owl. Hagrid's clothing is largely hand-made due to the descriptions of his clothing as being crafted of animal skin and far too large for a full-blooded or non-hybridised human being.  Despite his love for beasts, Hagrid was allergic to cats.[33]  Personality and traits  "I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place, but you can't pretend he's not careless." — Minerva McGonagall describing Hagrid's personality[src]  Hagrid was an incredibly warm, kind-hearted, intelligent, perceptive man, and would often forget his exceptional size and strength when patting people on the back. Another of Hagrid's greatest traits was his courage. He was also very loyal to his friends and was ready to defend them or fight for them if necessary. He was particularly loyal to Albus Dumbledore, describing him as a "great man". He would react with fury if anyone dared insult the headmaster and wouldn't hesitate to magically assault or rough up the offender. However, despite his loyalty, Hagrid was not good at keeping secrets and accidentally told Quirinus Quirrell, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger, the secret of how to get past his three headed dog, Fluffy, which all four of them used to get through to the Philosopher's Stone.[19] This was again shown when he revealed his half-giant status to Olympe Maxime, which Harry, Ron and Rita Skeeter all overheard, with the latter exposing it to the wizarding world by an article in the Daily Prophet.[28]      Hagrid in oven-mitts and an apron    "C'mon, now, get a move on! Got a real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin' up! Everyone here? Right, follow me!" — Hagrid's passion for magical creatures[src]  Hagrid had a great love of magical creatures, including cross-breeds such as the Blast-Ended Skrewt, and had a better relationship with most of the inhabitants of the Forbidden Forest than most people, including the centaurs, though he had little interest in tame magical creatures due to the lack of a challenge they offered. Despite this, he did show a good understanding of such creatures when he returned to his post as Care of Magical Creatures teacher, continuing lessons on unicorns after Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank.[17] Unfortunately he tended to overlook the dangers behind certain magical creatures, such as his dragon Norbert,[19] and his pet Acromantula Aragog, which was alleged by Tom Riddle to be the monster of Slytherin in 1943,[27] resulting in Hagrid's expulsion from the school. Hagrid never spoke about why he was expelled and would ignore any inquiries about it. Hagrid was fond of creatures in general and seemed to want to own any creature was even slightly fierce — his desires included a warthog and any dragon that he could get his hands on. He tended to give his pets ironic names, such as Fluffy for a vicious three-headed dog, and Fang, an affectionate Boarhound. Hagrid had a fondness for drinks and was sometimes known to be aggressive, especially when people insulted or dishonourably attacked those he cared about. After Vernon Dursley claimed that James and Lily Potter deserved their fates and called Albus Dumbledore a "crackpot old fool"[19], Hagrid threatened Vernon with his pink umbrella. When Igor Karkaroff accused Dumbledore of treachery and spat at his feet, Hagrid lifted Karkaroff off the ground and slammed him against a tree, roaring at him to apologise to Dumbledore.[28] When some Aurors stunned Fang and Minerva McGonagall, he was so outraged and disgusted that he attacked the Aurors, furiously denouncing them as cowards[17] and when he was younger, threw Tom Riddle to the ground when he framed Aragog of opening the Chamber of Secrets.[16]   "It's — all — my — ruddy — fault! I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!" — Hagrid's deep emotional concern for Harry's safety[src]  Despite this, Hagrid was a very sensitive person and was known to burst into tears when someone close to him was harmed or killed, or when he felt responsible for something that put his friends in peril, such as drunkenly telling Quirinus Quirrell how to get past his giant three headed dog, Fluffy.[19] His courage also concealed a deep fear of rejection and insecurity which was notably shown when he isolated himself after he was revealed as a half-giant and he attempted to resign from his position as the Care of Magical Creatures teacher until he was convinced otherwise by Dumbledore, Harry, Ron and Hermione.[28] When he was teaching, he also had a tendency to lose his self-confidence if his classes were disrupted such as when Buckbeak attacked Draco Malfoy, or if he believed people disliked his classes,[27] which he mistook for people disliking him.[29] Although he overlooked certain dangers, Hagrid also avoided doing anything against the Wizarding Law when he was under pressure such as when he avoided setting Buckbeak free, fearing he would be put back in Azkaban,[27] and when he tried hard to avoid getting dangerous creatures when under probation by Dolores Umbridge.[17] Hagrid was also a good and caring brother to Grawp, insisting on bringing him back to Hogwarts on finding he was being picked on for his (relatively) small stature by the other giants in his colony, and hiding in the forest, despite the frequent injuries and the trouble doing so caused him.[17] He also enjoyed cooking for his friends. However, his tendency to mostly cook foods suitable for himself and a lack of understanding of what his friends preferred eating meant that his cooking was usually turned down politely.[19]  Magical abilities and skills  "Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts. I'm — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff — one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job —" — Hagrid explaining to Harry his rare usage of magic[src]      Hagrid conjuring fire with the Fire-Making Spell   For a man who was expelled during his third year and rarely used magic as a result, Rubeus Hagrid was a rather good wizard, being considerably advanced, with some of his abilities even comparing to the N.E.W.T.-level academical difficulty. Being a Half-Giant, he also had magical abilities which stemmed from his giant blood, such as great superhuman strength and endurance along with a certain degree of magical resistance. Hagrid's hands-on and outdoor style of living allowed him to acquire other skills such as looking after magical creatures, craftsmanship, crossbowmanship and social networking within the magical community.   Magical aptitude: Despite having never graduated from Hogwarts and therefore not being fully trained in the magical arts as well as probably not often practising magic as he wasn't allowed to do so technically in his own admission,[19] as he had been expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was apparently destroyed some years earlier,[16] Hagrid's magical aptitude was clearly astonishing as he proved to be quite accomplished and skilled in magic enough that he was able to successfully conjure moderate levels of powerful magic. He was capable of performing successfully the majority of his spells using non-verbal magic via his umbrella-concealed wand, which only extremely powerful wizards and witches proved capable of using effectively. However, Hagrid's magic was never flawless as he was the only member of the Order of the Phoenix who could not cast the extremely powerful and difficult Patronus Charm. He additionally failed to completely transfigure Dudley Dursley into a pig, although he cast the spell non-verbally (non-verbal spells are usually less powerful than verbal spells unless cast by a powerful wizard or witch) and admitted that since Dudley was already so close to being a pig with his overweight physique and eating ways, he did not need to transfigure him completely, suggesting that Hagrid may have been able to do it but just chose not to further humiliate Dudley. He was also unable to repair Sirius Black's motorbike which had been heavily damaged during the Battle of the Seven Potters, though it must be noted that he was also struggling to control the motorbike and therefore he may just have been unable to exert enough magic to do so.  "He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers." — Hagrid attempting to turn Dudley Dursley into a pig[src]      Hagrid transfiguring Dudley Dursley       Hagrid conjuring water with Harry Potter   Transfiguration: Hagrid was at least moderately proficient in the field transfiguration, as shown in the Hut-on-the-Rock when he pulled off a partially successful transfiguration when he put a pig's tail on Dudley Dursley in a failed attempt to transfigure him into said animal. He could also perform conjuration; in 1991 he used the Fire-Making Spell, while in the Hut-on-the-Rock and in 1997 the Water-Making Spell, to put out a fire in his hut during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. This is impressive as transfiguration, especially Human Transfiguration, is considered one of the most difficult branches of magic and even experienced wizards struggle with it. In the latter case, however, Harry had to inform him of the incantation for the spell, which Hagrid's response suggested he didn't correctly memorise.  Rubeus Hagrid: "Gettin' on well, aren't they? Fer the Hallowe'en feast... should be big enough by then." Harry Potter: "What've you been feeding them?" Rubeus Hagrid: "Well, I've bin givin' them — you know — a bit o' help —" Hermione Granger: "An Engorgement Charm, I suppose? Well, you've done a good job on them." — Hagrid's use of the Engorgement Charm to enlarge pumpkins[src]  Charms: Hagrid was also accomplished with charms as he could cast a spell of his own that can enchant a boat to move on its own to a destination, which he used to transport himself and Harry back to the mainland from the Hut-on-the-Rock and used it on the Hogwarts boats to transport the first years across the Black Lake. Hagrid was skilled in the Engorgement Charm as he used it to enlarge his pumpkins to a giant size, his success impressing Hermione and Fred and George. Although he admitted to not having perfected it, he was competent enough in the Stamina Charm to successfully instruct members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who pursued a profession as a Magizoologist how to cast them. Non-verbal magic: Hagrid was quite skilled at using non-verbal magic, as shown when he both lit a fire non-verbally and transfigured a pig's tail on Dudley. These spells show that, even though Hagrid never graduated from Hogwarts, he had a powerful command of magic, as non-verbal magic was difficult to use (Hogwarts does not teach non-verbal magic until students are in their sixth year).  "Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Hagrid's got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owls ..." — Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank complimenting Hagrid's gift for training magical beasts[src]  Care of Magical Creatures: Hagrid was also extremely knowledgeable in Magizoology and was highly skilled in looking after magical creatures, interacting with them, and gaining their trust, including dangerous creatures which likely contributes from his experiences in the Forbidden Forest and with his pets. Hagrid's skill and knowledge in handling creatures allowed him to be the Care of Magical Creatures professor even though he was not a fully qualified wizard. Despite his skill and knowledge, many students considered Professor Grubbly-Plank a more qualified teacher for the subject as Hagrid preferred teaching dangerous creatures and could lose his confidence if students tried to disrupt his classes or if he believed they did not like his classes. However, when Hagrid stopped dealing with dangerous creatures too much and began to become more experienced in teaching, his skills proved to be impressive enough to make him a reasonable teacher, as he proved to be able to improve all of the students excluding Slytherin view on him that they all expressed shock that Dolores Umbridge would sack him, although many of them did not choose to continue the subject for N.E.W.Ts due to their past experiences with the dangerous creatures he taught. The dangerous and unpredictable creatures which Hagrid taught included hippogriffs, Blast-Ended Skrewts, and thestrals. Although he believed that tame and less harmful magical creatures did not pose many challenges, Hagrid nevertheless possessed a remarkable amount of knowledge on them as well as monstrous creatures, enough that he was able to effectively continue Grubbly-Plank's lessons on unicorns and he also taught nifflers and flobberworms. Some of the creatures Hagrid looked after included a three headed dog named Fluffy, his pet boarhound Fang, a baby dragon named Norbert, an Acromantula named Aragog, a hippogriff named Buckbeak and his half-brother Grawp, who was a giant. While his teaching methods were questionable, his knowledge helped Harry and his friends on numerous occasions, such as when they got past Fluffy while protecting the Philosopher's Stone, helped Sirius Black escape on Buckbeak, faced a Blast-Ended Skrewt during the Triwizard Tournament, and went to the Ministry of Magic using Thestrals. It should also be noted that his knowledge was such that he was initially the only person apart from Dumbledore who knew how to subdue Fluffy through music as even Severus Snape was unable to get past Fluffy without getting injured, and Quirinus Quirrell, under Voldemort's influence, had to gather the secret from a drunken Hagrid on how to get past Fluffy (which Harry, Ron and Hermione later learnt) especially considering Voldemort and Snape were both already highly powerful and intelligent wizards even in their youths while Quirrell had experience with handling dangerous animals like trolls. Hagrid was skilled enough to gradually earn the respect and loyalty of Grawp, despite the protests of Harry, Ron, Hermione and Firenze, along with Grawp's violent nature. Hagrid's knowledge in dealing with giants and other dangerous magical creatures also made Dumbledore order Hagrid to go alongside Olympe Maxime and attempt to recruit the giants to fight against Voldemort, which he most likely would have succeeded if not for the Death Eaters' interference and Golgomath's usurpation of the current Gurg, Karkus. Due to his friendship with Aragog, Hagrid was the only person who was able to visit the Acromantula tribe in the Forbidden Forest without being harmed, although this was lost after Aragog's death. Up until he rescued Firenze from the Forbidden Forest Centaur colony, Hagrid was among the very few that they respected and trusted, as he was able to visit them and interact with them cordially and Torvus even noted that Hagrid held enough influence that if Jacob's sibling was a friend of Hagrid, the Centaurs would consider trusting them as well and it was his advice that eventually allowed the student to earn their respect. Grubbly-Plank also noted that Hagrid had the Hogwarts thestrals well trained so that they didn't touch owls even though they were noted to have occasionally gone after birds. This talent also helped him as he was trusted with leading the Magizoologist faction of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force and had efficiently taught the recruits how to handle beasts safely. This can all indicate that Hagrid was a considerably talented person on the subject and this was clearly his strongest subject, possessing more knowledge than even wizards who were more powerful and intelligent, despite lacking the qualifications along with the teaching experience and understanding to fully engage his students when he first started teaching. Potions: Although not a well known skill of his and his actual level as a potion maker is unknown, Hagrid displayed a remarkable amount of knowledge in the subject. When he asked Jacob's sibling to brew the Fire-Breathing Potion in order to burn the Devil Snare holding Fang in the year 1985, he was able to thoroughly explain to the student all the ingredients needed to brew the potion and was aware that mint had cooling properties that would allow them to consume it without harming themselves. Superhuman strength: Due to his giant blood, Hagrid possessed great levels of superhuman strength, as shown when he broke the door to the Hut-on-the-Rock completely off its hinges along with refitting it and easily twisted Vernon Dursley's gun to a knot as if the gun was made of rubber when the latter threatened him. Hagrid's great strength also proved to be a big advantage when in battle such as when Dolores Umbridge brought Aurors with her during her attempt to sack and arrest Hagrid in 1996, throwing one of them about ten feet across the grounds and punched the other Aurors into unconsciousness, with the exception of one. This was again shown during the Battle of Hogwarts when he threw Walden Macnair across the Great Hall, a space which can easily fit all the students and staff at Hogwarts. The great strength of Hagrid was also seen whenever he tried to gently pat someone on the back, an act which usually sent the recipient flying. He also easily pulled apart Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy when they got into a fist fight at Flourish and Blotts, pinned Igor Karkaroff against a tree when the latter insulted Dumbledore and later restrained Olympe Maxime, another half-giant, when she attempted to attack two Death Eaters during their mission to recruit the giants. His strength also helped, given the kind of creatures he tended to look after, such as Fluffy, a gigantic three-headed dog, a 10-foot long Blast-Ended Skrewt and Aragog, an Acromantula the size of a small elephant (though seeing as he was Hagrid's friend, he might not have been that bad to look after). Given Hagrid's absurd ease in handling creatures as large as Acromantulas, three-headed dogs, and his half-brother, Grawp, it can be safe to assume that Hagrid is capable of lifting well over ten-thousand pounds and exerting far more force in combat. Hagrid was also able to control Madame Maxime's horses which were each described as being the size of an elephant and required forceful handling. Hagrid's own massive size would take extreme power just to be able to move, so for him to be able to move as effortlessly as he does, let alone exert his strength as he does must mean that his strength is enhanced by magical means as well as physical. In fact, his strength was such that he was described to have wrestled trolls in the Forbidden Forest as a boy. Even at the age of six, Hagrid was able to lift his father onto a dresser if he sometimes annoyed him, showing that his superhuman strength was present even in his early childhood, and before his third-year expulsion, knocked a teenage Tom Riddle to the ground when he attempted to attack Aragog. Hagrid also regularly hauls in the massive Hogwarts Christmas trees simultaneously by himself with no discernible strain, even though each one weighs at least several thousand pounds based on their described height and probable species. Based on this, the full extent of Hagrid's superhuman strength, while never seen explicitly in the series, most certainly makes him a force of nature in his own right. Superhuman endurance: Hagrid is also known for being able take quite a beating. Due to his outdoorsy line of work, Hagrid is able to exert himself at the peak of his superhuman strength for hours at a time without any known limits to how long he can maintain his stamina. Given that he is capable of keeping up with tutoring and taming his full-giant half-brother, Grawp, and still keep up with his lessons as a Hogwarts Professor, his duties as gamekeeper, maintaining a social life, and his various hobbies of tending to and caring for injured and sick animals in the Forbidden Forest, all while nursing injuries from Grawp, Hagrid certainly has vast levels of superhuman stamina that no other character has matched in the series. Hagrid's bodily tissues are also extremely strong, enhanced due to his giant blood, allowing him to endure beatings from his half-brother that would absolutely kill any ordinary man, regardless of their physical conditioning, although he still experienced visible and rather nasty wounds in the form of bruising and various minor cuts and lacerations throughout his body. Hagrid is also capable of withstanding torture from the likes of Voldemort and his Death Eaters, as evidenced by his maintaining of full consciousness after being captured during the first half of The Battle of Hogwarts. Spell resistance: Hagrid was resistant to stunning spells because of his giant blood. This also gave Hagrid some protection against curses, including moderate levels of Dark Magic as even the Death Eaters attempts to curse him after Dumbledore's death failed, which gave him an advantage whenever he was involved in a battle. Poison resistance: Due to Hagrid's work with various magical creatures, many of which are venomous and highly likely to carry disease, it can be assumed that Hagrid's magical resistance afforded him a degree of foreign chemical resistance as well. This can also be assumed in part due to his enormous size in accordance with his giant heritage, as toxicity in the body is relative to one's size and the amount of a foreign substance circulating within. This can also be seen in his difficulty with becoming intoxicated, as it took Quirrell several hours to get Hagrid drunk enough to divulge the information of how to get past Fluffy in the first chamber in 1992. In fact, Hagrid's resistance to alcohol toxicity was so strong that he was able to down an entire bottle of brandy in a single swig without any notable effects on his behaviour or cognitive functioning following the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997. Such a feat would likely be impossible for anyone of entirely human heritage without the aid of magic. Arbalist skills: Hagrid was also a skilled crossbowman, a crossbow being his primary means of defence as he was not (officially) allowed to use magic, limiting his experience in magical duelling. Physical combat skills: Hagrid was highly proficient at fighting physically. This was displayed in 1996 when Hagrid was attacked by Dolores Umbridge, along with some Aurors, who attempted to sack and arrest him. Hagrid managed to physically defeat all the Aurors effortlessly, which enabled him to escape from Umbridge. It should be noted that his combat was such that even Umbridge's remaining Auror was hesitant to attack Hagrid. Before that, he also rescued Firenze from the other centaurs in the Forbidden Forest after they attempted to kill him for accepting a teaching post in Hogwarts and escaped from the entire Acromantula colony of the Forest to give Aragog a proper burial all without any injuries, which is another testament to Hagrid's combat skills especially as both centaurs and acromantulas were powerful creatures in their own right. Also, in 1998, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Hagrid easily physically defeated Walden Macnair by throwing him across the Great Hall and he survived the battle. As Hagrid rarely used magic, he normally relied on these skills, his great strength, magical and physical endurance and possibly his crossbowman skills to fight in a battle and presumably used his skills to participate in the First and Second Wizarding Wars when he was a member of the Order of the Phoenix. However, he did occasionally use his umbrella-concealed wand when battling, indicating that he was willing to use magic against his opponents alongside his physical battling abilities when the time was right. Gamekeeping skills: Hagrid began his training as a Hogwarts Gamekeeper in 1943 after his third-year expulsion, possibly under Gamekeeper Ogg; it is known he would have been Ogg's assistant during the 1960s. Hagrid most likely was an efficient and skilled Keeper of Keys and Grounds as there was no mentioned blunder, replacement or substitute (with the exception of Professor Grubbly-Plank on two occasions) throughout his time in this position, and was able to keep up this position alongside his teaching duties as the Care of Magical Creatures professor and his duties for the Order of the Phoenix. These duties included escorting first-year students to Hogwarts, looking after the school keys, preparing for the Hallowe'en and Christmas feasts by preparing the pumpkins and Christmas trees respectively, performing secret and special tasks for the other Hogwarts teachers, and tending to matters which would be difficult for ordinary people and wizards to do such as tending to matters in the Forbidden Forest and looking after the magical creatures around the Hogwarts grounds. Cooking skills: Living alone in his cabin, Hagrid cooked for himself, though he would have meals in the Great Hall on occasion, such as the various school feasts. He apparently enjoyed his own food, though, being a half-giant, his tastes often clashed with those of his guests. He has been known to serve such foodstuffs to his guests as rock cakes that were too hard for a normal human to chew and a "beef casserole" that was actually made of some taloned creature. Hagrid had a tradition of making a festive treacle fudge for the other staff members at Christmas. Although he was under the impression that they loved it, this wasn't the case. But making it made him so happy that even Professor Snape couldn't bring himself to tell him so. Guests used to his cooking would often politely decline his food, even if it was something of his they had never tried, such as when Harry and Ron turned down some Bath buns he had made in 1994. However, one occasion when his cooking was appreciated was when he cooked some sausages for Harry the first time they met at the Hut-on-the-Rock, which Harry noted was tastier than anything he had eaten before starting Hogwarts. Tactical thinking and resourcefulness: Hagrid was also good both at being resourceful and thinking tactically when he was in a serious situation. When Aragog was accused of being Slytherin's Monster, Hagrid sent him to the Forbidden Forest to protect him, knowing it was the only safe place for him when Hagrid was expelled on suspicion of opening the Chamber of Secrets, also preventing Hagrid from getting in further trouble for his possesion of the Acromantula. This was again shown before he was temporarily sent to Azkaban when he sent a coded message to Harry and Ron, indirectly telling them to visit Aragog which, while it was almost fatal, allowed them to discover that Hagrid was innocent and determine the location of the Chamber of Secrets, in turn also resulting in Hagrid's release from Azkaban. Another instance is when he smuggled Grawp into the Forbidden Forest without even Umbridge's attention and tactfully brought Harry and Hermione to see him while the Quidditch Final was taking place, ensuring a distraction for the other Hogwarts residents. He also successfully escaped capture on two occasions by fleeing to the same cave Sirius Black and Buckbeak temporarily lived in: first was when Umbridge tried to get him both sacked and arrested due to her prejudice against Hagrid, and the second was when he was almost caught by the Death Eaters for holding a Support Harry Potter party during Voldemort's control over Hogwarts, taking Fang with him for both occasions and Grawp on the second occasion. He was also able to successfully determine that Voldemort was going to wage war on Hogwarts when he heard his message to surrender Harry from his cave, allowing him, Grawp and Fang to return to Hogwarts in time before the Battle of Hogwarts began. His resourcefulness was also demonstrated when he used a moleskin overcoat to carry most of his possessions while travelling, which would be useful in more serious situations if he had to fight in a battle during which he would be unable to carry the majority of his possessions by hand. Extreme dexterity: Given Hagrid's superhuman size and strength, his dexterity and coordination is well above average considering he is able to handle people and objects that are extremely delicate and fragile, such as Harry when he was just a baby without the slightest bit of difficulty. This level of control over his massive form is to the extent that he is able to weave bindings from stray unicorn tail hairs to secure bandages and splints on injured animals that he finds in the Forbidden Forest. Given that unicorn tail hair is an unusually fine material, Hagrid must have amazingly deft hands to be able to craft it in such a way. His lack of control over his strength is usually in response to his emotions, but it can be assumed that given a moment to concentrate he can control his massive bulk enough to achieve incredible manual feats. Craftsmanship skills: Due to Hagrid's hands-on style of living, he has developed great skill at building or creating things by hand, such as his clothes, his cabin, and various other items. He is a fine whittler as he crafted a flute from wood that he gave Harry for his first Christmas at Hogwarts that when played made a sound like an owl. He likely also made his commonly worn moleskin overcoat that contains a wide variety of items. Hagrid also likely built the pen that he used to hold the hippogriffs for his first lesson as Professor of Care of Magical Creatures, in autumn of 1993. Social networking: Due to Hagrid's work in the Order of The Phoenix and his skills at negotiating and making great connections within the magical community, especially with creatures of great pride such as the centaurs, he has great ability to make allies. Dumbledore specially chose Hagrid for this skill to be an envoy to the giants during the summer of 1995. Despite his lack of success due to the Death Eaters' interference and Golgomath's usurpation of the current Gurg, Karkus, Hagrid had great initial strides with the giant colony, showing his impressive social aptitude with magical creatures and beings of all levels of sapience and intellect. Musical skills: While not a very well known skill of his, Hagrid has shown adequate aptitude for music and would sing while enjoying a drink at events like Bill and Fleur Weasley's wedding and after Aragog's funeral. He also possessed enough skill in the area to create the wooden flute he gave Harry for Christmas in 1991, which when played created music that sounded a lot like the hooting of owls. His aptitude in music also helped him when dealing with certain magical creatures, such as being capable of playing a good enough music to easily make Fluffy fall asleep in order to calm him. Teaching skills: At first, due to his nervousness, teaching inexperience and desire to teach more dangerous magical creatures due to believing their greater quality, Hagrid was a poor teacher and his teaching ability was disliked by all, with only Harry, Hermione and Ron supporting him. In his first year as a teacher, his teaching ability was also hampered due to his first lesson being disrupted by Draco Malfoy, along with his concern over Buckbeak's safety after he attacked Malfoy for insulting him. However, over time as he gained more experience and started to teach more excitable creatures, he became good enough that although many of them still chose not to continue Care of Magical Creatures in their N.E.W.Ts, all but Slytherin students no longer complained as much about his teaching and openly admitted Hagrid's improvement, defending his teaching skills when he was sacked by Dolores Umbridge, which was to be expected from Umbridge's prejudice towards magical creatures, and expressing shock that it happened. By 2019, Hagrid had clearly improved reasonably, as he was trusted with teaching members of the highly important Statute of Secrecy Task Force who wanted to become Magizoologists and was able to do so succesfully, ranging from teaching the Stamina Charm, despite his less-than-perfect version, and giving them an effective elective regarding magical creatures. Leadership skills: Although mostly taking orders from Dumbledore and after he was gone the other professors, by 2019, Hagrid had clearly became at least a competent enough leader to be trusted with handling the Magizoologist faction of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, which clearly shows considerable leadership, being able to lead a rather large amount of magical beast handlers into handling Foundables that included Beasts without attracting the attention of Muggles. Hagrid's pets Main article: Rubeus Hagrid's pets     Hagrid with Fang   As early as in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and possibly earlier than that, Hagrid managed to gain possession of numerous magical creatures, many of them dangerous, including Aragog, Fang, Fluffy, Buckbeak, and Norbert (later Norberta). Hagrid's love for animals and his talent for taming and training them won him the post of Care of Magical Creatures Professor at Hogwarts. In their fourth year, Harry and his classmates were expected to help take care of Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts, one of which (grown to an enormous size) was placed in the hedge maze for the final task of the Triwizard Tournament.  Relationships Family  "She wasn' really the maternal sort. Well ... it's not in their natures, is it?" — Hagrid discussing his mother[src]      Grawp, his half-brother   Rubeus Hagrid was born to Mr Hagrid, a wizard, and the giantess Fridwulfa. Fridwulfa left the family because her son was "too small" for her liking, though Hagrid never seemed to resent her for abandoning him, generally appearing relatively indifferent about his lack of relationship with her. His father, on the other hand, seemed to be a very caring man who was heartbroken when his wife left, and was amused by the fact that, at the age of six, Hagrid was large enough to be able to set him on top of a dresser.[15] Mr Hagrid died when his son was twelve years old, and by the time Hagrid tried to find his mother in 1995, she too had died, although he dismissed the issue on the grounds that he barely remembered her. On the other hand, he was saddened by his father's death, though he was at least glad that his father did not live to see Rubeus expelled from school. During his travels to the Northern giant colonies that same year, Hagrid found his maternal half-brother: an undersized giant called Grawp. As Grawp's size made it difficult for him to function within his colony, Hagrid brought him back to Hogwarts and hid him within the Forbidden Forest. As Hagrid and Maxime's mission had failed, it is extremely likely that Hagrid also brought Grawp back to prevent his half-brother from being enslaved by Voldemort alongside the other giants. Hagrid's attempts to raise and socialise Grawp initially appeared completely pointless; Grawp's progress in picking up English, or in curbing his violence, which often left Hagrid with a number of painful looking injuries, seemed almost non-existent. However, over the course of the year, Grawp grew increasingly attached to his older brother and was distressed by Hagrid's disappearance after Dolores Umbridge attempted to have Hagrid arrested in 1996.[17] By Albus Dumbledore's funeral, Grawp was relatively calm and presentable, and he even attempted to comfort Hagrid by patting him (though a bit too hard) on the head and later embracing him.[29] Grawp spent the first part of the Battle of Hogwarts stumbling around, yelling for "Hagger," but eventually jumped into the fray, fighting the giants brought to the battle by Voldemort.[30]  Pets and other creatures  "He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously." — Hagrid's love of dangerous magical creatures[src]      Buckbeak the hippogriff   Hagrid had a good relationship with most of his pets and other magical creatures, most notably Fang, Aragog, and Buckbeak. His relationship with most magical creatures was arguably better then the ones most other wizards had.  Fang was usually Hagrid's companion most of the time, although he was cowardly. Fang demonstrated some protectiveness towards Hagrid in spite of his cowardly nature such as when he attempted to protect Hagrid when Dolores Umbridge and some Auror's attempted to sack and arrest him. Hagrid, in turn, was also protective of Fang as he was enraged when the Aurors had stunned him, carrying his unconscious body as he fled Hogwarts, and immediately went after Fang when he was afraid during the Battle of Hogwarts.  Hagrid had a huge friendship with Aragog, whom he had hatched in an egg when he was a student at Hogwarts. Hagrid protected Aragog when he was suspected to be the monster that opened the Chamber of Secrets, throwing Tom Riddle to the ground when he tried to curse him and sending Aragog to live in the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid managed to find Aragog a wife, Mosag, which allowed Aragog to have a family in the forest. Aragog, in turn, was grateful for Hagrid's friendship and protection to the point that he never directly harmed a human out of respect for Hagrid and commanded his family not to harm Hagrid while he was alive. However, this did not stop Aragog from letting his children and descendants attempt to eat Harry and Ron even though they were friends of Hagrid, claiming that he could not deny them fresh meat when it wandered into their midst. Hagrid was devastated when Aragog died and, along with Professor Slughorn, buried him near his Hut. Although Aragog's children and descendants did not hold back in attempting to devour Hagrid after Aragog's death, Hagrid attempted to protect them during the Battle of Hogwarts in honour of his friendship with Aragog, even though the Acromantulas were attacking both Death Eaters and Hogwarts defenders. Hagrid cared greatly about Buckbeak as he tried hard to prevent his execution by the Ministry of Magic and was overjoyed when he managed to escape with Sirius Black, unaware at the time that Harry and Hermione helped him escape. Hagrid was later reunited with Buckbeak and looked after him when Sirius was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange. Hagrid briefly had a pet dragon named Norbert, whom he had acquired from a disguised Quirinus Quirrell in exchange for knowledge on how to get past Hagrid's three-headed dog Fluffy. However, since dragons were illegal, Hagrid reluctantly allowed Norbert to be sent to Charlie Weasley in Romania and was devastated to let her go. When inquiring about Norbert from Charlie six years later, Hagrid was shocked to learn that Norbert was a female dragon, having mistaken her for a male dragon, and of her being renamed Norberta. Although the full extent of Hagrid's relationship with Fluffy is unknown, Hagrid used Fluffy to guard the entrance of the Underground Chambers where the Philosopher's Stone was being kept and before he accidentally told Quirrell, was the only one apart from Dumbledore who knew how to calm him. Hagrid also had a cordial relationship with the Forbidden Forest Centaur colony, especially with Bane, Ronan, Magorian and Firenze, and sometimes visited them whenever he went inside the Forest. However, Hagrid had a falling out with the centaurs when he defended Firenze from them as they believed Firenze had betrayed them by accepting the teaching post of Divination at Hogwarts, which was further complicated when he brought Grawp into the Forbidden Forest. During the Battle of Hogwarts, when Hagrid carried Harry, believing he was dead, back to Hogwarts, he was furious when the centaurs did not fight in the first half for Harry, accusing them of cowardice, which convinced them to fight in the second half of the battle. While Hagrid remained on good terms with Firenze, it is unknown whether Hagrid made peace with the other Centaurs after the battle ended.  Albus Dumbledore  "Great man, Dumbledore. 'S long as we've got him, I'm not too worried." — Hagrid discussing his trust in Dumbledore[src]      Albus Dumbledore, his dear friend   Albus Dumbledore placed great trust in Hagrid, which Hagrid returned with fierce loyalty and unwavering admiration. This loyalty always flared up whenever someone insulted Dumbledore, one time causing Hagrid to give Dudley Dursley a pig's tail, and causing him to choke Igor Karkaroff another time. Hagrid would often describe Dumbledore as a “great man.” While a professor, Dumbledore believed in Hagrid's innocence when he was accused of opening the Chamber of Secrets, and convinced then-Headmaster Armando Dippet to train Hagrid as the Gamekeeper and allow him to remain at Hogwarts.[16] Hagrid went on to join Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix as an adult, and he was the one tasked with bringing Harry Potter to Dumbledore after James and Lily Potter were murdered in 1981.  Dumbledore also trusted him to move the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts Wizarding Bank to the school and believed Hagrid could offer Harry as much protection as "a bunch" of Ministry Aurors could while shopping in Diagon Alley, in 1996.[29] In 1995, Dumbledore gave Hagrid the difficult task of approaching the giant colonies of the North and dissuading them joining forces with Lord Voldemort, knowing Hagrid was fully capable of the delicate handling required to court the Gurg.[17] Dumbledore additionally was the only one who supported Hagrid's decision to bring his giant half-brother Grawp with him back to Hogwarts after his mission to recruit the giants failed, allowing Grawp to stay in the Forbidden Forest and later having him sent to the mountains near Hogsmeade. After Albus Dumbledore's death, Hagrid was so devastated to the point that he was inconsolable, despite the best efforts of Olympe Maxime and even his half-brother Grawp.  Harry Potter  "Well. Hello. Yeh must be Harry. Hello, Harry Potter. I'm Rubeus Hagrid. And I'm gonna be yer friend whether yeh like it or not. 'Cos yeh've had it tough, not that yeh know it yet. An' yer gonna need friends. Now yeh best come with me, don't yeh think?" — Hagrid to baby Harry after the murder of the Potters[src]      Harry Potter, a good friend and student   Harry Potter and Hagrid shared a special relationship. Hagrid was one of the first people (if not the first) Harry could remember showing him genuine kindness and appearing to truly care for him. Hagrid was the one who introduced Harry back into the wizarding world, and he empathised with Harry's situation, as they were both a bit different from wizarding norm and were orphans who had been more or less left to fend for themselves.    "Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos ... knew yeh didn' have any ... d'yeh like it?" — Hagrid giving Harry a special photo album[src]  Hagrid was Harry's first true friend, and the two helped each other get through many difficult situations and constantly looked out for one another. Though Harry often took issue with Hagrid's penchant for collecting dangerous pets, as well as the fact Hagrid decided to bring his giant half-brother to Hogwarts,[17] he never failed to support Hagrid in his efforts to protect and care for all of them.    When Harry learned about Hagrid's half-giant status, he never showed any concern about it, citing his relationship to the Dursleys as an example of how people should not be judged by who they were related to but who they were themselves. Hagrid's kindness and friendship allowed Harry to come to terms with how being an orphan never leaves you, as Harry witnessed Hagrid still mourning his father's death even over fifty years since he passed. This bond between two orphans and Hagrid's reassurance that Harry's parents would be proud of him helped Harry to live with pride in his family. Hagrid was also the one who first told Harry about who his parents were and gave him his first true look at his heritage and family.     "HARRY! NO! NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT'RE YEH –?" — Hagrid's horror at seeing Harry sacrifice himself to Voldemort[src]  Hagrid was shocked and horrified when Harry came to Voldemort to be sacrificed and yelled at him to run. Hagrid was devastated when he thought Harry was dead and openly sobbed in front of the Death Eaters and rebuked the centaurs for not helping Harry. Hagrid returned Harry to the forest and was very gentle with his body. Hagrid was delighted when he found Harry was alive and was among the first people to congratulate Harry after he defeated Voldemort for the final time.  Hagrid also met Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley through Harry, and he presumably remained in touch with all three of them well after their time at Hogwarts, as in 2017, Harry reminded his son, Albus, that he had been invited to Hagrid's Hut for tea upon his arrival at Hogwarts.[30] In many ways, Hagrid served as a pillar of strength for Harry, giving him his first look at just how kind people can be, and gave Harry his first taste of kindness, which caught on like wildfire and served to groom Harry into the selfless guardian and warrior he became. Suffice it to say, were it not for Hagrid, Harry could have ended up a profoundly different person.  Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley  Hermione Granger: "Look, Hagrid's our friend, why don't we just go and ask him about it?" Ron Weasley: "That would be a cheerful visit. "Hello Hagrid! Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"" — Hermione and Ron about the monster in the Chamber of Secrets[src]      Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, his friends and students   Like Harry, both Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley had a close relationship with the half-giant. Though Ron was openly outraged by some of Hagrid's more dangerous pets, particularly Aragog, Hermione was more reserved with her comments and tended to be more proactive than either Ron or Harry when it came to helping Hagrid protect his creatures. She tried desperately to help him appeal Buckbeak's death sentence in 1994,[27] and in her fifth year, she made every effort to ensure sure Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures curriculum would give Dolores Umbridge no excuse to sack him.[17] When Rita Skeeter revealed that Hagrid was half-giant in the Daily Prophet, both Ron and Hermione stood by him and convinced him that despite all the prejudice he faced, there were still people who loved him and wanted him to stay at the school. Hagrid was on the point of resigning, but with their encouragement, remained at Hogwarts and continued teaching. Ron did show a certain level of concern upon learning of Hagrid's shock, given wizarding history regarding giants; Hermione, on the other hand, noted in an unsurprising tone that she suspected it long ago, seeing as his size fit the profile.[28]  Though Hagrid was himself a supporter of magical creatures, he disagreed when Hermione decided to create SPEW. Hermione pointed out how unhappy Dobby was being with Lucius, but Hagrid also pointed out that other house-elves considered him to be crazy. Hagrid came to Hermione's defence during her third year when she was in conflict with the boys (as Ron believed her cat had eaten his rat Scabbers, and Harry was angry that she had gotten his Firebolt confiscated). Hagrid was able to convince Harry and Ron of how poorly they were treating their friend, and eventually, he succeeded in getting the two to reconcile with Hermione.[27] He also encouraged Hermione during her fourth year to ignore the hate mail as he had following Rita Skeeter releasing a nasty article about Hermione in Witch Weekly. It is possible that Hagrid was close with Ron and Hermione's daughter, Rose Granger-Weasley and their son Hugo Granger-Weasley, as he was planning to have tea with Harry's son, Albus, in 2017.  Madame Olympe Maxime  Hagrid: "So…anyway…enough abou' me. What about you? Which side you got it on?" Madame Maxime: "It is chilly. I think I will go in now" Hagrid: "Eh? No, don' go! I've — I've never met another one before" Madame Maxime: "Anuzzer what, precisely?" Hagrid: "Another half-giant, o' course" Madame Maxime: "'Ow dare you!" — Hagrid and Madame Maxime[src]      Olympe Maxime   During the Triwizard Tournament, Hagrid began a romantic relationship with Madame Olympe Maxime, Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy. They were often seen together, talking and walking around the grounds, and they danced together at the Yule Ball. Though the two had a minor falling-out when Hagrid implied (correctly) that Maxime, like him, was part-giant, they eventually reconciled and travelled together to appeal to the giants of the Northern colonies and dissuade them from joining forces with Voldemort. Maxime was also seen comforting Hagrid during Albus Dumbledore's funeral. The current status of their relationship is unknown, but as Hagrid never got married, it can be assumed that their relationship did not work out.[2]  Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort  "Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid." — Riddle before he turned Hagrid in[src]      Tom Riddle   Hagrid was two years below Tom Riddle at Hogwarts, and in Hagrid's third year, Riddle opened the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing a Basilisk on Muggle-born students. After the death of Myrtle Warren, Hogwarts was in danger of closing, and to prevent that happening, Riddle framed Hagrid and his pet Acromantula, Aragog, for the crime. Hagrid protected Aragog from Riddle, throwing him to the ground when he tried to curse Aragog, making Hagrid the only person to challenge Riddle while he was a student. Despite this, Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts and had his wand snapped in half by the Ministry of Magic.[16] Believing in Hagrid's innocence, however, Professor Albus Dumbledore convinced then-Headmaster Armando Dippet to allow Hagrid to stay on at Hogwarts as Gamekeeper. Tom Riddle never felt remorse for framing Hagrid and ruining his life. As Riddle went on to become Lord Voldemort, Hagrid joined the Order of the Phoenix to fight against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. In 1981, Hagrid was devastated by the murder of his friends James and Lily Potter but was relieved when the Dark Lord disappeared after failing to kill young Harry Potter. Although many thought that Voldemort was dead, Hagrid, agreeing with Dumbledore, believed that he would return one day, as he believed that he did not "have enough human left in him to die". As with most of the wizarding community, he refused to speak Voldemort's name, and generally referred to him as "You-Know-Who." However, when he first explained Voldemort's background to Harry, he reluctantly said Voldemort's name. When Voldemort was searching for the Philosopher's Stone, he took advantage of Hagrid's love and knowledge of magical creatures and through Quirinus Quirrell, gathered the secret of subduing Fluffy through music from a drunken Hagrid, who was remorseful afterwards. Since Voldemort had a certain respect for Hogwart's professors, it is not known if that included Hagrid, who taught Care of Magical Creatures. This is unlikely considering Hagrid's half-giant status. In 1995, after his resurrection, Voldemort dispatched his Death Eaters to convince the giants to join their side, while Dumbledore had sent Hagrid and Olympe Maxime to do the same. While Hagrid and Maxime were on good terms with the Gurg, Karkus, the Death Eaters supported the giant Golgomath in an uprising that resulted in Golgomath beheading Karkus and taking over the giant colony. The giants then attacked Hagrid and Maxime, who were forced to retreat. In 1998, Hagrid fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and was captured by the Death Eaters. After Harry sacrificed himself to be killed, Voldemort ordered a grieving Hagrid to carry his friend's "dead" body in his arms, where it would be clearly visible to Harry's supporters. On the way back to the school, Hagrid expressed his fury with the centaurs for staying out of the fight, prompting them to join in soon after.[30] Hagrid was among the first to congratulate Harry after his defeat of Voldemort, showing his disdain for the Dark Lord. Although Hagrid's expulsion, and much of his later reputation for clumsiness, was originally Tom Riddle's fault, Riddle at least did not attach any special importance to his relationship with Hagrid, and at the Battle of Hogwarts, made no mention of their past. Hagrid, in turn, is never seen to admit to having known Riddle in their youth, and never referred to him except as 'You-Know-Who', or (once) by his preferred alias of Voldemort; indeed, Hagrid is terrified of him in the Battle of the Seven Potters, in spite of having known him. It was never confirmed if he ever knew that his former classmate and the Dark Lord were one and the same; however, since Hagrid said to Harry in 1991 that Voldemort was in Slytherin, it is likely that Hagrid knew.  Weasley family  "Another Weasley, eh?... I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the Forest!" —  Hagrid to Ron when they first met[src]      The Weasley family   Hagrid was on good terms with Molly and Arthur Weasley, who had both attended Hogwarts during the 1960s, while still Hagrid served as an assistant to his predecessor Ogg.[34]  He met them again in 1992, at Flourish and Blotts, when Arthur got into a fist fight with Lucius Malfoy. Hagrid broke up the fight and told Arthur that he should have ignored Malfoy, though he clearly sympathised with Arthur on acting the feelings Malfoy went out of his way to inspire. Hagrid was fond of the Weasley's due to their kind nature, immense courage, and their fair-minded views on Muggle-borns and half-humans like himself.  Twins Fred and George Weasley were friends of Hagrid since their time at Hogwarts. Hagrid seemed to be one of their favourite members of the staff, as he had a sense of humour and was not anywhere near as strict as many of the professors, though he mentioned that he spent "half his life" chasing the twins away from the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid also knew Charles Weasley quite well; Charlie had been one of the best Care of Magical Creatures students in his time at Hogwarts, and Hagrid described him as being "great with animals." He went on to study dragons in Romania, and Hagrid helped him with the dragons imported to Scotland for the Triwizard Tournament in 1994. Two years earlier, Hagrid had sent his pet dragon, "Norbert" to Charlie in Romania, and Charlie later informed Hagrid that "Norbert" was, in fact, actually "Norberta." Bill Weasley also attended Hogwarts before working in Egypt with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, and Hagrid encountered him numerous times when he moved back to England. Bill arrived with the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, where he was attacked by Fenrir Greyback. Hagrid was invited to Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour, in which Ginny, the youngest child and only daughter of the Weasley family, was a bridesmaid. Hagrid was quite fond of Ginny throughout her time at Hogwarts, and she was among the students who never even considered turning her back on Hagrid when she found out he was half-giant. Hagrid also knew she had a crush on Harry Potter, and playfully teased Harry about the fact in 1992. Hagrid did not appear to have much of a relationship with Percy Weasley, though it is unlikely they would have been very close before the Battle of Hogwarts, even if they had had more contact. When Percy was employed by the Ministry of Magic, he did not show any sign of protesting against the Ministry's criticism of Dumbledore's decision to employ Hagrid, as he was a half-giant and Percy disbelieved Dumbledore's claims of Voldemort's return. He also tried to persuade his younger brother Ron to support the Ministry of Magic in favour of Dumbledore, to whom Hagrid was fiercely loyal. However, Percy abandoned the Ministry once it fell to Lord Voldemort, apologised to his family, and fought against the Death Eaters at the Battle of Hogwarts, after which Hagrid would have undoubtedly thought better of him.  James and Lily Potter  "CAR CRASH! How could a car crash kill Lily an' James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!" — Hagrid defending Lily and James[src]      James and Lily Potter   Hagrid had been a good friend of Harry Potter's parents, Lily and James, since the time they attended Hogwarts. Hagrid admired them for being amongst the best wizards and witches of their age. Hagrid became a member of the Order of the Phoenix around the same time as James and Lily, and they fought together throughout the First Wizarding War. Hagrid was beside himself when Lily and James were killed in 1981; Albus Dumbledore sent him to rescue their infant child, Harry, from the wreckage of their home in Godric's Hollow, and Hagrid later reintroduced Harry to the wizarding world in 1991.    Hagrid knew them very well and conveyed the truth about them to their son, who had been lead to believe insulting lies about them and their deaths, restoring and preserving their legacy in their son. Hagrid also kept a leather-bound family album of them which he gave to Harry, which Hagrid came into possession of through unknown circumstances, but might have been entrusted to him by Lily and James to give to their son. Hagrid was known to respect them for their desire to fight for what was right.  Sirius Black  "Look ... I knew Sirius longer 'n yeh did ... he died in battle, an' tha's the way he'd've wanted ter go -" — Rubeus Hagrid to Harry Potter on Sirius Black[src]      Sirius Black   Though Hagrid described Sirius Black as having been a "trouble-maker" in his youth, Hagrid had clearly been fond of him, as well as his best friend, James Potter, when they were students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After graduating, Sirius, along with James, Lily Evans, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew, joined the Order of the Phoenix around the same time as Hagrid.  When James and Lily discovered they were Voldemort's next targets, they went into to hiding with the use of the Fidelius Charm; Peter Pettigrew had been made their Secret-Keeper, unbeknownst to anyone else, and betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, framing Sirius for the crime. For many years, everybody, including Hagrid, believed Sirius was the betrayer. The night James and Lily died, Hagrid met Sirius in Godric's Hollow, where Hagrid had been sent to rescue the infant Harry Potter from the wreckage of the Potter's destroyed home, and Sirius lent Hagrid his flying motorbike to deliver Harry to Albus Dumbledore. By 1993, Hagrid was horrified to think that he comforted the "murdering traitor" that very night and deeply resented him for his betrayal, raging that had he knew, he would have attacked Black in retaliation. Hagrid learned the truth in 1995 once Voldemort returned, a year after Sirius escaped from Azkaban and exposed Pettigrew as having been in hiding as Ron Weasley's pet rat, Scabbers. When Harry and Hermione Granger helped Sirius avoid the fate of receiving the Dementor's Kiss, they also saved Buckbeak, who was poised for execution as ordered by the Ministry of Magic, and in doing so, provided Sirius with transportation to make his escape.[27] Dumbledore re-instated the Order of the Phoenix in 1995, and following Sirius' tragic death during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996, Harry inherited Buckbeak, whom he sent back into Hagrid's care at Hogwarts.[29] Hagrid was saddened by Sirius's death and tried to comfort Harry the best he could, saying that having known Sirius, he was confident that Sirius wanted to go down the way he did, which he truly deemed a valiant way to die.  Hogwarts staff     Remus Lupin   Hagrid would have known Remus Lupin for about as long as he knew the Potters and Sirius Black, though they did not appear to be particularly close until 1993 when Lupin was appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and they became co-workers. Both Hagrid and Lupin knew what it was like to be within the wizarding community, yet still considered outsiders and face its prejudices, as Lupin was a werewolf and Hagrid was a half-giant. In 1995, they both joined the re-instated Order of the Phoenix and worked together throughout the Second Wizarding War to protect Harry Potter and bring about the end of Lord Voldemort.      Minerva McGonagall   Hagrid greatly respected Minerva McGonagall, the Transfiguration professor and Head of Gryffindor House. They attended Hogwarts around the same time (Hagrid having been expelled a few years before she started) and they later became members of the Hogwarts staff. As one of the most strict professors at Hogwarts, McGonagall sometimes disapproved of Hagrid's lack of refined behaviour, especially during the Sorting ceremony. However, they were close friends and fellow members of the Order of the Phoenix in both wars.   In 1995, when Dolores Umbridge brought several Ministry officials to either have Hagrid forcibly removed from the school grounds, arrested, or both, McGonagall immediately came to Hagrid's defence; she took four simultaneous stunners straight to her chest as she rushed to Hagrid's aid, and was incapacitated for some time at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Hagrid was disgusted and outraged when McGonagall got stunned to the point that he attacked the Ministry officials who injured her, furiously denouncing them as cowards.   After Albus Dumbledore's death, McGonagall stated that she appreciated Hagrid's opinion very much, as Dumbledore had, and took it into consideration when determining the best time to close the school. McGonagall later became Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Hagrid was still living by 2017. Also, McGonagall showed no disdain when Hagrid drunkenly kissed her on the cheek at a Hogwarts Christmas celebration. On the contrary, she began to giggle and blushed. McGonagall was touched by Hagrid's defence of wanting to bury their mentor, Albus Dumbledore on Hogwarts's grounds, citing that no other Headmaster had given more to the school, and as such defended his stance on the matter.       Severus Snape   Hagrid always stoutly defended Severus Snape against Harry's doubts and allegations, on the basis that Albus Dumbledore trusted Snape completely. When Snape killed Dumbledore, Hagrid initially disbelieved the fact and told Harry he must be mistaken but was later furious to learn that Snape had indeed killed the late Headmaster. Hagrid openly opposed Snape when he became the Headmaster of Hogwarts by holding a Support Harry Potter party (unaware Snape was secretly still on their side), an act which almost resulted in his arrest and forced him to go into hiding until the final battle. Before Hagrid fled, Snape put students in detentions with Hagrid, ensuring that they were protected from the harsher and torturous punishments from the Carrows. However, Hagrid eventually learned of Snape's true loyalties during the final confrontation of the Battle of Hogwarts. Hagrid and Argus Filch regularly found themselves at odds; Filch thought that Hagrid was "an oaf," and even told Mrs Norris, his cat, to keep an eye on the Gateskeeper. Filch did not seem to care or even really acknowledge when Hagrid became a professor, possibly because he was a half-giant, and Hagrid, for his part, called Filch a "sneakin' Squib", when the latter insulted him.      The centaur Firenze   Hagrid had been very familiar with Divination Professor Firenze, long before he began working at Hogwarts, and when the centaur's herd turned on him for entering into "the servitude of a human" by accepting the position at Hogwarts as a favour to Headmaster Dumbledore, it was Hagrid who saved him. Of all the centaurs Firenze seemed to be the most active in working against Lord Voldemort and was not above allowing Harry Potter to ride on his back in the process of saving Harry's life — both of which elicited great respect and gratitude from both Harry and Hagrid. Hagrid also seemed to be on good terms with Horace Slughorn, the Potions master in 1996. It is possible that Slughorn was one of Hagrid's teachers at Hogwarts, but they later became co-workers. Slughorn attended Aragog's funeral and comforted Hagrid, and while this was mostly because he wanted to extract some of Aragog's valuable venom, Hagrid was touched nonetheless, and the two enjoyed a drunken salute to the late Acromantula. Hagrid initially held Quirinus Quirrell in high regard, considering him a very talented and clever wizard, and initially seemed to have a good relationship with him, especially when he introduced Quirrell to Harry in the Leaky Cauldron. However, due to his loyalty to Voldemort, a disguised Quirrell later took advantage of Hagrid's love for magical creatures and manipulated a drunken Hagrid into revealing the secret of getting past Fluffy in exchange for a dragon egg. Hagrid was later horrified and guilt-ridden when he learnt of Quirrell's true nature after his death, calling him an "evil git" and blaming himself for Harry's injuries during his encounter with Quirrell and Voldemort.  Hagrid had a mixed relationship with Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank as while she worked as a substitute for Hagrid in Care for Magical Creatures and his gamekeeping duties when Hagrid was absent or had a mission to do, he slightly envied her teaching skills, which made other students (including Harry, Ron and Hermione) consider her a superior teacher to him for Care of Magical Creatures. This also made him accept Harry, Ron and Hermione's untrue claims of Grubby-Plank being a "terrible teacher" when they attempted to reassure him that they still cared for him despite not taking the subject for their sixth year. Grubbly-Plank on the other hand seemed to respect Hagrid for his skills and abilities despite the students considering her a better teacher than him, as she complimented Hagrid's training of the school's Thestrals and also kept silent about his mission to recruit the giants when Harry inquired her about his whereabouts, understanding the importance of his classified mission.  Hagrid disliked Gilderoy Lockhart, as did the other teachers, due to him being an annoyingly obnoxious and an incompetent teacher. Hagrid did not read any of Lockhart's books, rejected his ideas of Harry trying to hog the spotlight, and openly criticised him, something that he would normally not do to a teacher.      Dolores Umbridge   The professor with whom Hagrid had the most difficult and antagonistic relationship was, by far, Dolores Umbridge, who was a pure-blood supremacist with a particular dislike for what she called "half-breeds." Throughout the 1995–1996 school year, she made Hagrid's life miserable with her disruptive evaluations of his teaching (part of her role as Hogwarts High Inquisitor, during which she was unabashedly condescending and critical.)  When a student released two nifflers in her office, following Headmaster Dumbledore's departure from the school, she blamed Hagrid, although he had a rock solid alibi. She later brought Ministry officials to Hagrid's Hut in the middle of the night, either to arrest or forcibly remove him from the premises, though Hagrid was able to resist with the help of Minerva McGonagall and go on the run.  Hagrid was disgusted by Umbridge's and the officials attack on McGonagall, attacking the Ministry officials in retaliation, although he refrained from attacking Umbridge in order to escape from Hogwarts. Following the Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest, Umbridge was eventually suspended from Hogwarts in 1996 and Hagrid was reinstated as a teacher. She was also imprisoned in Azkaban two years later for her crimes against Muggle-Borns because of her actions as Head of the Muggle-Born Registration Commission.  Hogwarts students  Luna Lovegood: "He isn't a very good teacher, is he?" Harry Potter, Ron and Ginny Weasley: "Yes, he is!" Hermione Granger: "Erm ... yes ... he's very good." Luna Lovegood: "Well, we think he's a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw." — Luna Lovegood, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley and Hermione Granger discussing Hagrid's teaching abilities[src]  Apart from Harry, Ron and Hermione and the other Weasley children (excluding Percy), Hagrid seemed to have a good relationship with Lee Jordan who was a friend of Fred and George Weasley as he once shook Hagrid's hand, along with Fred and George, when he returned after his mission to find the giants. Apart from them, the other students had a mixed relationship with Hagrid which was especially evident while he taught Care of Magical Creatures.  Although many of the students had a relatively civil relationship with Hagrid outside his teaching, most of them considered Professor Grubbly-Plank a more qualified teacher for the subject since Hagrid sometimes lost his confidence and preferred teaching dangerous creatures.[28] The Gryffindor students expressed the most enthusiasm when he assumed the post but after Draco Malfoy caused Buckbeak to attack him by insulting him and when Hagrid preferred teaching monstrous creatures over creatures which were tame, their enthusiasm on the subject reduced.[27] Despite this, Hagrid arguably had the best relationship with the Gryffindor students as he was once a Gryffindor himself and was regularly seen supporting Gryffindor during Quiddich matches alongside the other Gryffindor students. Luna Lovegood believed that Hagrid was a poor teacher and said that Ravenclaw students considered him a joke.[17] It is unknown what relationship Hagrid had with the Hufflepuff students, although it is possible their relationship was also mixed like the other students. However, while the other students mostly disapproved his teaching methods, Hagrid had an antagonistic relationship with the Slytherin students as they, encouraged by Draco Malfoy, were also prejudiced against Hagrid due to his status as a half-giant,[17] and Draco's attack by Buckbeak, without caring that Draco did not listen to Hagrid in the first place.[27] However, despite Hagrid's mixed relationship with them, most of the students with the exception of Slytherin opposed Dolores Umbridge alongside Hagrid and disapproved of Umbridge's harsh and critical treatment of Hagrid due to her prejudice against part-humans. They also believed that Hagrid had improved in his teaching by the time he was temporarily sacked by Umbridge although many of them did not take the subject for N.E.W.Ts due to their past experiences with the dangerous creatures he taught. They were also extremely angry when Hagrid was attacked by Umbridge, again excluding the Slytherin students. Hagrid also opposed the Death Eater's control of Hogwarts alongside many of the students, including holding a Support Harry Potter Party in his Hut, and also fought alongside them against Voldemort and the Death Eater's during the Battle of Hogwarts.  Dursley family  Vernon Dursley: "I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!" Rubeus Hagrid: "Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune." — Hagird insulting Vernon Dursley[src]      Vernon, Petunia, and Dudley Dursley  Hagrid was sent by Albus Dumbledore to inform Harry Potter of his true identity on Harry's eleventh birthday in 1991 after it was revealed that Hogwarts' letters to him were getting blocked by his aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, both Muggles who hated and feared magic.  Eventually, Hagrid found Harry and his family in an old shack out at sea (Vernon Dursley had become paranoid with the amount of Hogwarts letters arriving at their home, so he had temporarily vacated their home in the hopes that they would throw off any wizards possibly following them.) After giving Harry a birthday cake, he introduced himself to Harry, believing him to know everything about the wizarding world (from the letter left by Albus Dumbledore.) Upon learning that Harry knew nothing, Hagrid became furious at the Dursleys for not telling him anything.  When Hagrid proceeded to tell Harry that he was a wizard, Vernon became angry and admitted that they had known for years and had been trying to "stomp it out of him", including admitting that they lied to Harry in telling him that his parents had really been killed in a car crash. This further enraged Hagrid, but Vernon continued to try and keep Harry from going to Hogwarts, going so far as to call Albus Dumbledore a "crackpot old fool". This, however, sent Hagrid over the edge; he lost his temper and used his pink umbrella to give Dudley Dursley a pig's tail. This terrified Vernon and Petunia enough to let Hagrid take Harry. Eventually, they would remove the pig tail, but the encounter added a newfound fear of magic to the Dursleys' hatred of it. The incident scared Dudley so much that he instinctively grabbed his bottom when meeting the Weasleys, despite them being friendly wizards.  Malfoy family  "Yeh should've ignored him, Arthur. Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that — no Malfoy's worth listenin' ter — bad blood, that's what it is — " — Hagird's scathing opinion of the Malfoy family[src]      Lucius and Draco Malfoy, his enemies   Hagrid was disgusted by the Malfoy family's pure blood supremacist values, their open ill-treatment of Muggle-borns and "blood traitors," their allegiance to Lord Voldemort and their disrespect towards Albus Dumbledore; even going so far as to accuse them of 'bad blood', rather against the principles espoused by Dumbledore. In turn, the Malfoys disliked Hagrid, regularly mocking him and doing nearly everything in their collective power to get him sacked from his post at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In 1992, Hagrid broke up a fight between Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy in Flourish and Blotts, though Hagrid was more sympathetic to Arthur. During the 1992–1993 school year, Lucius was indirectly responsible for reopening of the Chamber of Secrets, as he had used the earlier scuffle with Arthur Weasley to slip Tom Riddle's diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron full of books. Hagrid was blamed for the attacks, just as he had been fifty years earlier when he was framed by Tom Riddle for the Chamber's first opening. Hagrid was arrested as a precautionary measure by Cornelius Fudge, where Hagrid reacted angrily to Lucius' unnecessary presence and ordered him out. Lucius mocked Hagrid by wondering how his small hut could be considered a "house" and claimed he was only there to inform Dumbledore that he and the other governors had voted on his suspension. Hagrid saw through Lucius and accused him of threatening the other governors, which later proved to have been exactly the case.   "What're you doin' here? Get outta my house!" — Rubeus Hagrid to Lucius Malfoy[src]  Hagrid did not get along any better with Lucius' son Draco. Even before meeting Hagrid for the first time, Draco slandered him when talking to Harry Potter for the first time, describing him as "...a sort of savage - lives in a hut in the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed." Hagrid first met Draco in 1991 when he was sorted into Slytherin. During that year, Draco was put in detention with Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom. Hagrid called Draco an "idiot" when he scared Neville, and in 1992, was outraged when he heard Draco called Hermione a Mudblood. Draco was in Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class in 1993 and ignored Hagrid's advice on how to handle Hagrid's hippogriff Buckbeak. Draco insulted Buckbeak, causing the hippogriff to lash out and cut Draco's arm. Hagrid took Draco to the Hospital Wing, but Draco swore revenge, and deliberately exaggerated his injury to get Hagrid into trouble. Lucius was furious when he found out and took legal action against Hagrid and Buckbeak. Hagrid tried hard to defend Buckbeak, but the court ruled in favour of Lucius, largely due to his influence at the Ministry, and Buckbeak was sentenced to death, but later freed by Harry and Hermione.  In Draco's fourth year, he openly disobeyed Hagrid by saying that he would not be coming down to look after the blast-ended skrewts, saying that he spent too much time with them during regular class. Hagrid, hearing about the previous punishment 'Moody' gave Draco, threatened to turn him into a ferret. Later that year, Draco happily provided Rita Skeeter with skewed details about the events of the previous year and delighted when Hagrid temporarily went into hiding following Skeeter's publication of the article revealing that Hagrid was half-giant. In his fifth year, Draco spoke negatively regarding Hagrid during Dolores Umbridge's inspection of a Care of Magical Creatures class conducted by Professor Grubbly-Plank, likely hoping that Hagrid would be placed on probation when and if he returned to Hogwarts, an outcome that did indeed come to pass. Given that Draco's wife Astoria helped to raise their son to be a kinder man than Draco was in his youth, it can be assumed that Scorpius Malfoy had a better relationship with Hagrid than his father did. This is also likely due to Scorpius being best friends with Albus Potter who was already a good friend of Hagrid's before his first year.  Order of the Phoenix members     The original Order of the Phoenix   Hagrid was friendly with most members of the Order of the Phoenix. Some of them were Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, the Weasley family, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, James and Lily Potter, Severus Snape, and Minerva McGonagall. Hagrid also knew and greatly admired Alastor Moody, and Moody's protege, Nymphadora Tonks. They fought together in several battles, including the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of the Seven Potters, where Hagrid was devastated by Moody's death. Tonks later married Remus Lupin, and their son, Teddy, would attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after both his parents were killed at the Battle of Hogwarts. Hagrid was also familiar with Dedalus Diggle, whom he introduced to Harry Potter at the Leaky Cauldron in 1991.  Death Eaters and enemies     Voldemort and his Death Eaters in the Forbidden Forest   As Hagrid was a member of the Order of the Phoenix, he disliked the Death Eaters and tried to thwart their plans most of the time. The Death Eaters whom Hagrid knew the most were Severus Snape, Lucius Malfoy and his son Draco, clashing with Lucius before he was put in Azkaban, and had clashes with Draco while he taught Care of Magical Creatures. Snape, on the other hand, defected from Voldemort, and Hagrid defended him whenever Harry, Ron and Hermione criticised him, except when he temporarily believed that Snape had betrayed Dumbledore at the Astronomy Tower. Apart from the Malfoys, Hagrid also had an antagonistic relationship with Walden Macnair, who was a polar opposite to Hagrid's love and admiration for magical creatures. They first clashed when Buckbeak was going to be executed, with Macnair being Buckbeak's intended executioner, then for a second time when Macnair persuaded the giants to join Voldemort and as a result foiled Hagrid and Olympe Maxime's own attempt to convince the giants to join Dumbledore, and a third time when Hagrid threw him across the Great Hall during the Battle of Hogwarts, knocking him unconscious. Hagrid also knew Igor Karkaroff, as he once choked Karkaroff against a tree and told him to apologise to Dumbledore for accusing him of complicity in an attack on Viktor Krum. Thorfinn Rowle also tried to attack Hagrid following the Battle at Astronomy Tower and set his hut on fire. He later angrily silenced Hagrid when the latter tried to discourage Harry from sacrificing himself.  Etymology Rubeus in Latin means "red".[35] The name suited Hagrid, as red could be for passion or emotion, "an earthy, warm and physical man, lord of the forest".[36] Hagrid is the archaic past participle of the verb "hagride",[37] which means "harass or torment with dread or nightmares", and its etymology in turn is "hag" and "ride".[38] A hag is a nightmare spirit in English folklore. According to folklore, the Hag sat on a sleeper's chest and sent nightmares to him or her. When the subject awoke, he or she would be unable to breathe or even move for a short period of time. This state is now called sleep paralysis, but in the old belief the subject had been "hagridden".[39] Hagrid also may mean "hung over," as from alcohol.[citation needed]  Behind the scenes     Hagrid as illustrated by Mary GrandPré in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows   Hagrid was the first person to tell Harry that he resembled his father, but had his mother's eyes. He was also Harry's first friend. It is unknown why no one calls Hagrid 'Rubeus', which is his first name, although when Hagrid meets Harry for the first time he tells him to call him Hagrid as that's what everyone calls him. This probably means that Hagrid tells people to call him by this name. The only individuals known to call Hagrid by his first name were Garrick Ollivander and Tom Riddle, who have both known him since he was a child. Given Hagrid's interest in unusual pets, it is possible that his activities may have caught the eye of the Illegal Pets Detection service at some point. Hagrid was not charged for raising Aragog under the Ban on Experimental Breeding because it was enacted in 1965, 22 years later. There are two common interpretations of Hagrid's statement to Harry about failing to turn Dudley into a pig on their first meeting- the first is that he genuinely tried to do so but failed due to the spell's complexity, or Dudley's general pig-like nature as he stated. The other is that he intended to give Dudley a tail and was only joking about attempting a full transformation.     Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid   Hagrid was portrayed by the late Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2 and so is one of the 14 characters to appear in all 8 film adaptations. Robbie Coltrane was J. K. Rowling's first and only choice for the role of Rubeus Hagrid. She did not, however, create the character with Robbie Coltrane in mind. He was instead, according to Coltrane, "based on a Hell's Angel she knew in the West Country. ...he was just huge and terrifying. And then he would sit down and talk about his garden and how his petunias had been very bad that year."[40] This is the reason why Coltrane is the only known actor to not speak in their native accent, instead speaking in a West Country accent, which is the only English accent noted for rolling of the 'r' sound, and often silencing 'h' sounds, which also became a stereotypical accent of pirates, because Robert Newton, who played the main character on Treasure Island, is actually from Devon in southwestern England.[41] As well as being Rowling's first choice for the role of Hagrid, Coltrane was also the first person cast in the movie. Interestingly, Coltrane is one of the few actors to play a character older than themselves (Hagrid is in his 60s throughout the series, whilst Coltrane was 51 when he first played Hagrid and 61 the last time he did.) American actor Robin Williams wanted the role of Hagrid and called director Chris Columbus as well as casting director Janet Hirshenson if he could get the part. However, the "strictly British and Irish cast" rule imposed by J.K. Rowling prevented him from getting the role, and Columbus with Hirshenson had to reject him out of respect for Rowling's wishes.[42] Robbie Coltrane returned to the part of Hagrid in 2014 and shot 3 different scenes for the official Wizarding World of Harry Potter website on which Hagrid welcomes the viewer in the Diagon Alley expansion.     Robbie Coltrane was usually filmed from a low camera angle to make him appear larger   Since Robbie Coltrane is not really 8-feet 6-inches tall, he was usually filmed from a low camera angle to make him look bigger (usually Harry's angle) or the other actors are filmed from a high camera angle.[43] Hagrid appears smaller in the films than in the novels, as the filmmakers describe him to be 8 feet 6 inches tall (as opposed to being 11 feet six inches in the books). Curiously, it says on Hagrid's Ministry card that he is 11.5 feet tall and weighs 289 pounds. However, this would mean that he is dangerously underweight, as his Body Mass Index (BMI) is only 10.6. The only other known character to be below the range is Porpentina Goldstein with a BMI of 17.8. The fact that Hagrid should be facing life-threatening symptoms from being all skin and bones is self-defeating: he is frequently described as huge and bulky in the books, and he is portrayed in the films by an obese actor (he weighed 280 pounds and was six feet tall).[5][44][45] For Hagrid's weight to match his superhuman stature, he would like have to weigh in at over 1,000 pounds, as when you double an object's volume, you actually quadruple its weight to maintain structural integrity relative to the Earth's gravitational pull on its mass. Martin Bayfield played Hagrid as a teenager during the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and was dubbed by Robbie Coltrane. Bayfield also often served as the role of Hagrid's body double, wearing a prosthetic Hagrid suit, in scenes such as the final scene of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in which Hagrid waved goodbye to Harry.[46] Mark Theodore, the actor portraying both the Sorting Hat and Hagrid in the Year 2 and Year 3 casts of the West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, again portrayed Rubeus Hagrid, voicing him when the cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child read aloud Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 5 (Diagon Alley) together, organised by Bloomsbury Publishing for the 2021 Harry Potter Book Night.[47][48] In the extended version of 'JK Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe - A conversation',[citation needed] it is revealed that Rubeus is pronounced Roo-Bay-Us. It is unknown why Rowling did not ask for this to be the same in the films, somewhat like Voldemort, which in the books is pronounced with a silent T, except in the British Audible Renditions and American Audible Renditions of the last 3 books. When Harry mentions Hagrid at the conclusion of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the year is 2017, and Hagrid is one year off turning 90 years old.     Hagrid's bad spelling: "Happee Birthdae Harry"   In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone: Hagrid seems to have poor spelling, as seen when he shows Harry his birthday cake. In addition to this, when Hagrid tells Harry about how his parents were killed, Harry asked You-Know-Who's name. Hagrid responded he didn't want to say his name and when Harry suggested to write it down, Hagrid said he couldn't spell "Voldemort". He doesn't have spelling problems in the books, as the notes he wrote to Harry were with perfect spelling. Interestingly, in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery he says he "can't spell fer the life o' me".[49] When Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached Hagrid to ask him about the Philosopher's Stone, Hagrid is playing the Harry Potter theme tune on his flute.       Throughout the series, it is implied that Hagrid had been the Hogwarts gatekeeper since he was expelled from school in 1943. But at one point in Goblet of Fire, Molly Weasley, who attended Hogwarts between 1961 and 1968, reminisces about Hagrid's predecessor, Ogg, in contradiction to this implication. However, it is stated by Tom Riddle in Chamber of Secrets that Dumbledore reportedly persuaded Headmaster Dippet to keep Hagrid on as part of the staff and have him trained for the position, meaning he started out as Ogg's apprentice.         Hagrid in the console version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)      Hagrid in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4   J. K. Rowling states on her website that Hagrid is allergic to cats, as well as being hinted at in the first book, which could explain why he dislikes Mrs Norris so much. Fans of the series raised an immediate outcry upon learning that Hagrid never married.[citation needed] J.K. Rowling responded to the criticism by simply saying, "At least I didn't kill him."[citation needed] His name (and Dumbledore's) come from a passage in chapter 20 of the Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy. "Hag-rids" (as it is in the Mayor of Casterbridge) referred to indigestion. In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, it was rumoured that Hagrid had an evil twin brother named Dirgah. In the credits of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Hagrid is listed as "Hagrid the Giant", despite being a half-giant, technically-speaking. Hagrid's LEGO mini-figure incarnations consist almost entirely of pieces exclusive only to Hagrid, specifically the body and beard pieces. His head in and of itself is not an exclusive piece, but his face pattern is. Hagrid is a playable character in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4. In the game, he can fly on a broomstick in the game in spite of the fact that he claims in the books to be too large to ride broomsticks.[50] In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, Hagrid is the first playable character, at the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley. As Hagrid was expelled, he only has one spell on his Spell-Wheel, which is Wingardium Leviosa. However, after the player makes it to Hogwarts, he obtains his crossbow. Hagrid is unlocked in "The Forbidden Forest" level, by using Reducto on a silver chest in the third area. It is suggested, perhaps unintentionally on the author's part, in Philosopher's Stone, that Hagrid had previously met Harry's uncle Vernon Dursley, insofar as he addresses him familiarly when speaking to him in the Hut-on-the-Rock, and held something of a low opinion of him, calling him a 'great prune' and treating all he said with contempt.
