When Mustafa learned of Laurena's death, he was driven insane out of grief. Shortly before his death, Mustafa made his son swear an Unbreakable Vow to kill the person whom Corvus IV loved the most.[4]  Personality and traits According to his son Yusuf, Mustafa was very much in love with his wife, indicating that he was a devoted husband, and he even went insane with grief after learning of her death. Indeed, Mustafa became so overwhelmed by his grief that he forced his son to give an Unbreakable Vow to avenge his family' ruin by killing the one Corvus IV loved the most.  Etymology His name means "the chosen one" in Arabic, an epithet of Muhammad.  Behind the scenes Mustafa Kama is played by Hugh Quarshie in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.[5] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 3 images related to Mustafa Kama.
