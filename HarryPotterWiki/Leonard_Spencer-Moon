Leonard Spencer-Moon   Biographical information  Born Before 1922   Blood status Pure-blood or half-blood[1]   Title(s) Minister for Magic    Physical information  Species Human   Gender Male    Relationship information  Family members Lily Moon (possibly)Dennis Moon (possibly)Moon family    Affiliation  Occupation Tea-boy in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes (formerly)British Minister for Magic (1939-1948)   Loyalty Moon familyBritish Ministry of MagicDepartment of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes (formerly)   [Source]  Minister Leonard Spencer-Moon was Minister for Magic from 1939 to 1948. He was elected at least twice. Spencer-Moon began his career at the Ministry of Magic as a tea-boy in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, and rose through the ranks from there. He became Minister for Magic following his predecessor, Hector Fawley's, political downfall for not taking Gellert Grindelwald's "For the Greater Good" revolution seriously. He proved himself a sound Minister, overseeing a period of great international turmoil in both the wizarding (global wizarding war) and the Muggle world (Second World War). He was also known to have maintained a good working relationship with Winston Churchill, the Muggle Prime Minister.[2]  Behind the scenes Coincidentally or not, "Leonard" was Winston Churchill's middle name. Also, Churchill was born into the family of the Dukes of Marlborough, a branch of the Spencer family (Churchill's full name was, indeed, "Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill"). Moon may be related to the Lily Moon sorted before Harry in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
