Despite the fact that she grew up living in the No-Maj world, she displayed signs of magic from an early age[2] and was taught about the traditional magic that existed in their family by her grandmother.[7] In her youth, she attended Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and gained a wand made of rosewood with an African mermaid hair core.[5] During her school life, she became best friends with Porpentina Goldstein, and knew her younger sister Queenie as well, growing up together.[1] When they graduated from Ilvermorny, Lally and Tina stayed close friends.[5] At some point during her schooling, Eulalie came across the written work of Professor Albus Dumbledore in the school library, and proceeded to write the author to share her thoughts on it. Dumbledore, who recognised Eulalie as wise beyond her years, wrote back, a decision that heralded many years of correspondence between the two, during which he became something of a mentor to her.[7]  Teaching career Sometime after her graduation, Eulalie at some point was hired as the Ilvermorny Charms professor. Evidently a respected member of the teaching staff, she was also named the school's Keeper of the Keys by the headteacher of the day.[2] Eulalie at some point released a book on charms titled Advanced Charm Casting.[8] Lally became acquainted with Newton Scamander at some point, and became fan of his book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. She first met him in 1932 and told him that she had made his book mandatory reading for her all fifth-years at Ilvermorny. He too appreciated her work.[9]  Alliance with Dumbledore and movement against Grindelwald  Eulalie Hicks: "What's happening?" Nicholas Flamel: "Exactly what he said would happen. Grindelwald rallies tonight at the cemetery, and there will be death!" Eulalie Hicks: "Then you gotta go!" Nicholas Flamel: "What? I haven't seen action in two hundred years..." Eulalie Hicks: "You can do this, Flamel. We believe in you." — Eulalie Hicks to Nicolas Flamel[src]      Nicholas Flamel talks to Eulalie Hicks   On September 1927, Eulalie became aware that Nicolas Flamel was reaching out via phoenix-embossed books to her and he told her that Gellert Grindelwald was holding a dangerous rally in Paris. Eulalie, unable to do anything herself at the time, urged him to do what he could and assured him that they all believed in him.[10]   Newt Scamander: "Uh - Lally - Lally, I believe you were given some reading material?" Eulalie Hicks: "You know what they say; a book can take you around the world and back, all you have to do is open it." — Newt and Eulalie[src]      Eulalie Hicks "dresses" Jacob with a spell   In 1932, Hicks agreed to take a more active part in the anti-Grindelwald movement by joining an army to assist Dumbledore in thwarting Grindelwald's rise to dominance over the wizarding world. Shortly before this team was due to meet up at The Great Wizarding Express headed for Berlin, she was sent to recruit the Jacob Kowalski, who had grown disillusioned with wizardkind after losing Queenie Goldstein. To accomplish this, Hicks travelled to his bakery in New York and, with the help of her cousin Stanley and his friends, staged an altercation where she pretended to be harassed by them so Jacob would come to her rescue in order to remind him of his bravery, worth and value to their cause. During the incident, when the men "threatened" Jacob Kowalski when he confronted them, she paralysed Frank Doyle from behind, which revealed the whole scene as a ruse. She then entered Jacob's bakery, and after some reluctance from him, she managed to convince him to come with her.[4]      Eulalie and Jacob disappearing from the Candidates' Dinner   Having transported Jacob and herself away with the help of a Portkey made from one of her own books, Hicks brought her new companion to a place where the pair of them could join the rest of the group on the train via the Floo Network. Once there, she met Newt Scamander for the first time. She also met Theseus Scamander, Yusuf Kama and Bunty Broadacre. Together, they travelled to Berlin to visit the German Ministry of Magic. There, they witnessed the acquittal of Grindelwald by Anton Vogel, much to their shock, and attended the Candidates' Dinner, where they stopped an assassination attempt on Vicência Santos, with Hicks also having to save Jacob after he confronted Grindelwald at the dinner and made himself look like the assassin.[4]      Dumbledore's first army gathering in the Great Hall   After the group members completed their missions, they all met at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Lally spoke to some students in the Great Hall about the importance of studying Charms. She was informed of the Eyrie in Bhutan by Dumbledore and travelled there via a portkey in the Room of Requirement, to attend the walk of the Qilin. She was handed a duplicated copy of Newt's suitcase before travelling to deceive Grindelwald's followers there, as the real suitcase contained a living Qilin that was paramount to stopping Grindelwald.[4]      Lally and Theseus in a duel in Bhutan   When in Bhutan for the ceremony, Lally and Theseus Scamander fought Grindelwald's followers in the streets when they sought to take their suitcases, defeating many, but they were soon outnumbered. However, upon Helmut opening the fake suitcases, him and Grindelwald's men were attacked by various enchanted objects within, allowing Lally and Theseus to escape. Lally witnessed Grindelwald's defeat in the election, his electoral fraud being exposed and his subsequent escape.[4]      Eulalie, the Scamander brothers, and Tina Goldstein attending the wedding in New York   Sometime later, Professor Hicks attended Jacob's and Queenie's wedding in Kowalski's Quality Baked Goods with her fellow comrades and her friend, Tina Goldstein, who she asked to tell her about the new luminaries at MACUSA.[4]   Personality and traits Lally was shown to be an intelligent, learned and witty witch. She was also kind and supportive, given how she encouraged Jacob Kowalski to believe in himself. She also had a strong sense of morality and bravery, given how she opposed Gellert Grindelwald and his followers and worked diligently and firmly to assist Albus Dumbledore in stopping him. She was also sensible, given how she recommended Jacob show restraint during their mission, and also resourceful, effortlessly using magic to save herself in dangerous situations.[4] She was also shown to advocate education, being a professor, given how she encouraged Hogwarts students to study Charms.[4]  Magical abilities and skills     Lally paralysing Frank Doyle   Charms: As a Professor of Charms at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hicks was an authority on this branch of magic[6] and even authored a book on the subject titled Advanced Charm Casting.[11] She could cast charms such as the Full Body-Bind Curse and Atmospheric Charms proficiently and nonverbally.[4] Apparition: Lally appeared to be capable of apparition, having appeared in Jacob Kowalski's bakery after having only been in the street moments before, not having used the door to enter.[4] Defence Against the Dark Arts: Albus Dumbledore noted that she possessed superb skills in defensive magic, to the point where he had no qualms about entrusting her with the task of thwarting a possible assassination attempt at the Candidates' Dinner in Berlin, and she had no qualms about "welcoming the challenge".[4]     Lally launching crystal balls at enemies   Duelling: In Bhutan, she, with the help of Theseus Scamander, fought and defeated Helmut's men despite the two of them being greatly outnumbered. During this skirmish, she was shown to be resourceful by utilising the environment around her; she bewitched garments that had been hung up to dry to restraining one of the Aurors she was combating, thus putting him out of the battle, and also levitated crystal balls and wooden barrels into the air and launched them at them, knocking several of them over.[4] Nonverbal magic: Hicks could cast nonverbal spells swiftly with remarkable ease and precision. She was able to nonverbally paralyse Frank Doyle.[4] Possessions     Eulalie Hick's wand   Wand: Hicks was able to wield this wand in the 1930s.[4] It was made of African rosewood and had an African mermaid hair core.[5] Key: As the Keeper of the Keys at Ilvermorny, Professor Hicks carried a key to the school with her at all times.[2] Portkey book: Eulalie Hicks had a book that served as a Portkey.[4] Etymology "Eulalie" is the French form of "Eulalia", which is derived from Greek ευλαλος (eulalos) meaning "sweetly-speaking", itself from ευ (eu) "good" and λαλεω (laleo) "to talk". The surname "Hicks" is an English patronymic derived from "Hick", which is from the medieval personal name "Hicke", a pet form of "Richard" (meaning "powerful ruler"). "Hicks" is a widespread surname in England, and is common in the southwest and southern Wales. Behind the scenes Eulalie Hicks is played by Jessica Williams in a cameo in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, and also in a larger and more significant role in Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore.[12] Jessica Williams stated that Eulalie came from the No-Maj world,[2] though it is unclear if she was No-Maj-born or from a wizarding family that lived among No-Majs.
