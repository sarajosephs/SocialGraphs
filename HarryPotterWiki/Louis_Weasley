Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology The name "Louis" is the French form of Ludovicus, the Latinised form of Ludwig. From Old German hlod and wig, meaning "fame" and "warrior". The king Clovis I (5th century) was the first Christian king in France. This was the name of eighteen kings of France, starting with Louis I, the son of Charlemagne (8th century), and including Louis IX (Saint Louis), who led two crusades, and Louis XIV (the 'Sun King'), who was the ruler of France during the height of its power, the builder of the Palace of Versailles, and the longest reigning monarch in the history of Europe.  Behind the scenes Louis is the only known male in canon with Veela blood. J. K. Rowling's great-grandfather was also named Louis. It is unknown whether Louis Weasley is named in honour of him. Appearances J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life (First mentioned) Pottermore (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 Although it has never been confirmed that Septimus and Cedrella are Arthur's parents, this can be inferred based on Sirius Black's statement in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 6 (The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black) that Arthur was "something like [his] second cousin once removed." The Black family tree establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both Orion and Walburga Black, Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree as both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown.
