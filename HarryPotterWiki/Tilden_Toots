Toots hosted his own radio show on the subject of magical gardening, called Toots, Shoots 'n' Roots, in which he gave considerable knowledge and advice to other wizards and witches in this field.[1] Potions: Toots was also a professional Potioneer, having invented at least two of his own gardening based potions, the Rejuicing Potion and Regerminating Potion, showing his excellent skills in this field of magic.[1] Behind the scenes On J. K. Rowling's official site, Tilden Toots' radio show could sometimes be heard when one switched on the radio in Extra Stuff, prior to the site's redesign in 2012. If he attended Hogwarts, Toots might have been in the same year as the Marauders, Lily Evans, and Severus Snape. If he was not, he was in the year ahead of them. He had a broad West Country accent as an adult, which suggests he spent the better part of his youth in the West Country where there are several magical settlements. His condition is a reference to the idiom "to have a green thumb", an expression used to describe someone's affinity or skill at gardening or growing plants.
