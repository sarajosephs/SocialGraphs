She was in the same year as Harry Potter and was sorted into either Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin house.  Behind the scenes Smith appeared on the student list shown by J. K. Rowling in Harry Potter and Me, but her given name was only partially visible, appearing to begin with "Ge-". On  Pottermore, Rowling revealed that the character's given name was originally "Georgina," but that this was crossed out and replaced with "Sally."[3] It is possible Sally is one of the many unidentified Hufflepuff girls. Appearances Harry Potter and Me (First mentioned) Pottermore (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ J. K. Rowling's original list of forty students contains five males and five females from each house. As all five Ravenclaw females are known, the remaining females whose houses are unknown must be in one of the other three houses.  ↑  Pottermore (transcription available here)              Categories         Categories:   British or Irish individuals    Females    Smith family    Sorted in 1991    Unknown House    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Français Polski      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
