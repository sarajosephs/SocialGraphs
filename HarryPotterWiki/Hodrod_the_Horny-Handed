Hodrod the Horny-Handed   Biographical information  Nationality British    Physical information  Species Goblin   Gender Male    Affiliation  Occupation Activist   [Source]  Hodrod the Horny-Handed was a goblin activist who shrunk three wizards and then tried to crush them.[1] The Ministry of Magic arrested him for these actions. This did not sit well with the goblin community, because when the Brotherhood of Goblins met with representatives from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures in Chipping Clodbury, they demanded that he be released.[2] Hodrod was also mentioned in a question on the third W.O.M.B.A.T. test, which gave his imprisonment as one of several possible motivations for the Goblin Rebellions of the 17th and 18th centuries. This answer is obviously a red herring, because the Chipping Clodbury Riot occurred at least two centuries later, in 1999.
