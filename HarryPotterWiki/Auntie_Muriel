Her surname is unknown; it may be Prewett, but only if she is related to Molly on her father's side. During her youth, Muriel eavesdropped on a conversation between her mother and Bathilda Bagshot, listening in secretly from behind a door. She learned that the Dumbledore brothers had an altercation at their sister Ariana's funeral.[8]  Second Wizarding War (1997-1998)  "...and your hair's much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin's beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelette... Isn't Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?" — Muriel's unpleasant demeanour[src]  Muriel allowed the Order of the Phoenix to use her home as a safe house during the Second Wizarding War.[7] In the Battle of the Seven Potters on 27 July, 1997, this house was the planned destination for Tonks and Ron Weasley.[9] Muriel attended to the pair upon their arrival there.[9] Muriel owned a goblin-made tiara which she claimed had been in her family for centuries.[8] After being persuaded by her great-niece, Molly Weasley,[10] she lent the tiara to Fleur Delacour, who wore it at her wedding to Molly's son, Bill.[8]     Harry Potter, Elphias Doge and Muriel sitting at Bill and Fleur's wedding in 1997   Muriel was also invited to the wedding, but was a rather unpleasant presence, drinking copious amounts of champagne and belittling the other guests.[8] At the wedding, she also interrupted a conversation Elphias Doge and Harry Potter (disguised as "Barny Weasley") were having about Albus Dumbledore, which she had overheard as she was walking past. Muriel and Doge proceeded to have a heated argument regarding Dumbledore. Doge, being a childhood friend of Albus, defended him passionately from the claims Muriel argued with that were based on evidence supplied by Rita Skeeter's new book, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore and what she had heard Bathilda Bagshot tell her mother.[8]     Muriel (bottom right) attending Bill and Fleur's wedding   In early 1998, Muriel allowed most of the Weasley family to take refuge in her house, as they had become targets of the Death Eaters.[11] Fred and George Weasley, unable to run their shop in Diagon Alley, began selling their products by owl out of Muriel's back room, much to her chagrin.[12] She also took in Garrick Ollivander, who returned the tiara to her, at Fleur's request.[12] She may have possibly owned Shell Cottage before Bill and Fleur.[5]  Physical appearance At age one hundred and seven, Muriel had a beaky nose, red-rimmed, bloodshot eyes, and bony fingers. She wore a feathery pink hat that was described as giving her the appearance of a "bad-tempered flamingo."[8]  Personality and traits  Ron Weasley: "Wow. You look great!" Hermione Granger: "Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn't agree. I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She said, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?' and then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles'." Ron Weasley: "Don't take it personally, she's rude to everyone." — Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in 1997[src]  Muriel was a loud, ill-mannered, and extremely rude woman who was able to find fault with everything and everyone. When she insulted Hermione Granger in 1997 for having "bad posture and skinny ankles" and rudely referred to her as a Muggle-born, Ron urged her not to take it personally, since Muriel was rude to everybody. Among her other insulting remarks were that Xenophilius Lovegood looked "like an omelette" in his yellow robes, that Ron's long hair made him nearly indistinguishable from his sister, that George's ears were "lopsided" after his right ear had been magically cut off, and that Ginny's dress was "far too low cut." Based on her insult to Hermione, she may have disliked Hermione's Muggle-born status[3] and based on her reaction to Bill marrying Fleur, she seemed to hate Fleur's status of being French.[13] Muriel liked to use her advanced age as a justification for her impolite actions, in spite of the fact that she seemed quite strong for her age.[8] Muriel enjoyed gossip and was a fan of poison-pen journalist Rita Skeeter, stating that she "always" read Rita's work, and that she was eager to pre-order a copy of her book The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.[8] She was also shown to use Skeeter's points as fact and parts of her arguments, for example when she was arguing about Albus Dumbledore she brought up points made in Skeeter's book. Despite her rude behaviour, Muriel did have a soft side, as she lent her goblin-forged tiara to Fleur for her wedding with Bill despite an implied dislike of her and, more importantly, when the Weasley family was in danger of being arrested by Death Eaters, she allowed them to hide in her home.  Relationships Weasley family  "Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes." — Muriel upon her introduction to "Barny Weasley"[src]      The Weasley family holidaying in Egypt   Muriel was not fond of her great-niece's family, the Weasleys, but nonetheless opened her home to them when they were in danger. She came to the Burrow for dinner every Christmas until Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair. She likely wrote them both out of her will for this stunt.[8] According to Molly Weasley, however, Muriel had a soft spot for Bill.[10] It seems she had a distant relationship with Ron and Ginny, as she seemed to insult Ron a lot, and only called Ginny by her given name rather than her preferred nickname. She also disapproved of her great-great niece's dress at the wedding, thinking it was inappropriate.  Etymology The name "Muriel" is the Medieval English form of a Celtic name which was probably related to the Irish name Muirgel. It was brought to England from Brittany by the Normans. In the modern era, it was popularised by a character from Dinah Craik's novel, John Halifax, Gentleman (1856). It is also of Gaelic origin.  Behind the scenes Muriel was played by Matyelok Gibbs in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.[14] In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Muriel's scene is much smaller than in the book, and it is not introduced as to who she is. She has some similarities to Harry’s aunt Marge, although they obviously have differences: for example, Muriel was a witch and Marge was not.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (First mentioned) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (First appearance) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game) (Voice and mention only) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (Mentioned only) Pottermore Wizarding World Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Muriel says she is 107 on August 1, 1997, however, it is not her birthday. Her birthday could have been, at the earliest, August 2, 1889 - any earlier would make her older than 107 - and July 31, 1890 - any later would make her younger than 107. This means that she was born between August 2, 1889 and July 31, 1890.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 It is mentioned that Molly is pure-blood, so that her family has to be. However, Muriel may have married a great-uncle of Molly's. If this is the case, then Muriel is no blood relation of Molly or her family and could, conceivably, be a half-blood or a pure-blood.  ↑ 3.0 3.1 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 8 (The Wedding) - Hermione recounts that immediately upon meeting her, Muriel said, 'Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?' before insulting her, making it unlikely that Muriel is a Muggle-born.  ↑ Molly's red hair is, in her Ministry file, said to be a "family trait". If Muriel is a blood relative of Molly's then there is a chance that she too was, at one point, red haired.  ↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1  ↑ 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 Pottermore states that she was "technically Mrs Weasley's great aunt" making the Weasley children her great-great nephews and niece, Mr Prewett her nephew or nephew-in-law and Mrs Prewett her niece or niece-in-law  ↑ 7.0 7.1 7.2 7.3 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 4 (The Seven Potters)  ↑ 8.0 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.4 8.5 8.6 8.7 8.8 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 8 (The Wedding)  ↑ 9.0 9.1 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 5 (Fallen Warrior)  ↑ 10.0 10.1 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 29 (The Phoenix Lament)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 24 (The Wandmaker)  ↑ 12.0 12.1 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 25 (Shell Cottage)  ↑ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 8 (The Wedding) - "She's a good-looking girl, but still – French."  ↑ Deathly Hallows casting updates: Aunt Muriel, Mafalda and Clemence confirmed     Order of the Phoenix      Founder:Albus Dumbledore   Leaders:Albus Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Kingsley Shacklebolt   Original Order of of the Phoenix:Aberforth Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Alice Longbottom | Arabella Figg | Benjy Fenwick | Caradoc Dearborn | Dedalus Diggle | Dorcas Meadowes | Edgar Bones | Elphias Doge | Emmeline Vance | Fabian Prewett | Frank Longbottom | Gideon Prewett | James Potter | Lily Potter | Marlene McKinnon | Mundungus Fletcher | Peter Pettigrew (defected) | Remus Lupin | Rubeus Hagrid | Severus Snape | Sirius Black | Sturgis Podmore   Reconstituted Order of the Phoenix: Aberforth Dumbledore | Alastor Moody | Arabella Figg | Arthur Weasley | Bill Weasley | Charlie Weasley | Dedalus Diggle | Elphias Doge | Emmeline Vance | Fleur Delacour | Fred Weasley | George Weasley | Harry Potter | Hermione Granger | Hestia Jones | Kingsley Shacklebolt | Minerva McGonagall | Molly Weasley | Mundungus Fletcher | Nymphadora Tonks | Remus Lupin | Ron Weasley | Rubeus Hagrid | Severus Snape | Sirius Black | Sturgis Podmore   Order of the Phoenix allies:Andromeda Tonks | Augusta Longbottom | Buckbeak | Dobby | Fawkes | Filius Flitwick | Firenze | Garrick Ollivander | Ginny Weasley | Grawp | Helena Ravenclaw | Horace Slughorn | Karkus | Karkus's wife | Kreacher | Lee Jordan | Luna Lovegood | McKinnon family | Mr Westenberg | Mrs Westenberg | Muriel | Nearly-Headless Nick | Neville Longbottom | Oliver Wood | Olympe Maxime | Rita Skeeter | Peeves | Percy Weasley | Pomona Sprout | Poppy Pomfrey | Sybill Trelawney | Ted Tonks | The Fallen Fifty | Westenberg family | Winky | Xenophilius Lovegood   Other affiliations:Dumbledore's Army | Forbidden Forest Centaur colony | Headless Hunt | Hogwarts Hippogriff herd | Hogwarts house-elves | Hogwarts Ghosts | Hogwarts Staff | Hogwarts students | Hogwarts Thestral herd | Ministry of Magic | Giant colony (Karkus's control)             Categories         Categories:   19th century births    Centenarians    English individuals    Females    Order of the Phoenix allies    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Suomi Français Nederlands Norsk Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
