He had very good knowledge of defensive spells and Dark charms and how to perform them, and was highly knowledgeable of various dark creatures, meaning he had likely experienced them himself. Etymology "Trimble" is most likely a derivation of "tremble", meaning "to shake" - fitting considering his career as an author of books against the dark forces. As the shaky Professor Quirrell was the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher in the year that Harry Potter purchased Trimble’s book, it is likely to be a reference to that. Behind the scenes Professor Trimble's name is considered to be misspelled "Quintin Trimble" on his portrait in the films.[5] But the truth is that Quintin is a variant of spelling. It may be a hint to the fact that he also was the 15th Hogwarts headmaster (15th is 'quindecim' in Latin). Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 3 images related to Quentin Trimble.

J. K. Rowling stated at the Edinburgh Book Festival on 15 August 2004 (source) that all portraits at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are of deceased individuals. Therefore, Trimble died in or before 1986.  ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4
