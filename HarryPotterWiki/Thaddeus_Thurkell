He transfigured them into hedgehogs out of disgust.[1][2] The birth of a single Squib to a magical parent was known to be a rare event.[3] This would seem to indicate that the case of the Thurkell family was quite exceptional, especially as it merited mention on a Chocolate Frog Card.[1][2]  Contents  1 Magical abilities and skills 2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Magical abilities and skills Transfiguration: Thaddeus successfully transformed his sons into Hedgehogs out of disgust for their Squib statuses.[1][2] Given how both Human Transfiguration and Trans-Species Transformation are both highly advanced and complex forms of transfiguration, this is proof of skill in this field. Etymology The name "Thaddeus" comes from Θαδδαιος (Thaddaios), the Greek form of the Aramaic name Thaddai. It is possibly derived from a word, meaning "heart", but it may in fact be an Aramaic form of a Greek name such as Theodoros.
