Pierre Bonaccord   Biographical information  Nationality French[1]   Title(s) Supreme Mugwump[2]    Physical information  Species Human[2]   Gender Male[2]    Affiliation  Occupation Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards[2]   Loyalty International Confederation of Wizards[2]   [Source]    "… the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord, but his appointment was contested by the wizarding community of Liechtenstein, because —" — Harry Potter starting  to answer question ten of the 1996 History of Magic O.W.L.[src]  Pierre Bonaccord was a French[1] wizard and the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards.[2]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography Bonaccord wanted to ban troll-hunting and grant rights to trolls, possibly granting them full "being" status as opposed to them being classified as "beasts". However, a tribe of Mountain Trolls had been causing a lot of trouble in Liechtenstein, so their wizarding community contested Bonaccord's appointment, and refused to join the Confederation as a result.[2]  Etymology "Pierre" is a French form of Peter. This name was also borne by Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919), a French impressionist painter, and by Pierre Curie (1859-1906), a physicist who discovered radioactivity with his wife Marie. A "bon-accord" is an expression or token of good will.
