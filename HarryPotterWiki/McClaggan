McClaggan tried to defend Dumbledore, much to Travers's irritation, before being ordered to follow Minerva McGonagall out of the classroom.[2]  Behind the scenes McClaggan was portrayed by Alfie Simmons in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. In an Instagram story on 3 January, 2021, actor Alfie Simmons referred to the character as "the grandfather of a character from the originals".[3] However, this is made dubious by the fact that the two names, McLaggen and McClaggan, are spelled differently. Other characters in Fantastic Beasts, such as Chang, also appear to be based on the grandfathers of original Harry Potter characters. It may be possible that McClaggan is a maternal relative of the McLaggen family or that the family name might have changed spelling over time.
