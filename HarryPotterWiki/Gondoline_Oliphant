For her achievements in Magizoology, she was featured on a silver Famous Wizard card as part of the Chocolate Frog Card series.[3][1][4][2] There was a bust of her at Hogwarts Castle, on a secret passage leading from the fourth floor to the second floor.[4]  Etymology The surname Oliphant is derived from an archaic English word for "elephant." J.R.R. Tolkien included huge, elephant-like creatures known as oliphaunts in his novel The Lord of the Rings. The name Gondoline is perhaps a further nod to Tolkien: in the Silmarillion, there was an Elven city called Gondolin, which remained hidden for centuries before being destroyed.
