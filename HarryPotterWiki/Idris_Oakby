In her adult life, she set up a charitable organisation called Society for the Support of Squibs which supported Squibs and helped them live in the Wizarding world.[1] She may have been frowned upon by other wizards and witches for her charitable work, considering how poorly Squibs were generally viewed in the magical world, however.  Death and Post-Mortem Oakby died in 1985 at the age of 113.[1]  Etymology The name "Idris" means "ardent lord" from Welsh udd, meaning "lord, prince" combined with ris, meaning "ardent, enthusiastic, impulsive".
