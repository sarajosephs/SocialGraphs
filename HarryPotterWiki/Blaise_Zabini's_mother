She was famously beautiful, and married seven wizards who each died in mysterious circumstances, leaving her with a large amount of gold from each. Her fame was known to Horace Slughorn, who invited her son to his compartment on the Hogwarts Express for that reason as a member of the Slug Club.[1]  Behind the scenes It is unknown if Zabini was her maiden name or one of her married names. It is speculated that she killed each of her husbands, to gain their inheritance, given the mysterious nature of their deaths.
