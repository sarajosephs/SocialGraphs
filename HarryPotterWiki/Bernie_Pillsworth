Isn't your wife in for questioning today? Er - what's happened to you? Why are you so wet?" Ron Weasley (as Reginald Cattermole): "Yaxley's office is raining. I couldn't stop it, so they've sent me to get Bernie - Pillsworth, I think they said - " Arthur Weasley: "Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately. Did you try meteolojinx recanto? It worked for Bletchley." — Arthur speaking with Ron disguised as Reginald Cattermole[src]  Bernie (surname possibly Pillsworth) was a British wizard who worked at the Ministry of Magic.[1] Under the disguise of Reginald Cattermole, Ron Weasley was told to fetch Bernie after failing to stop rain from falling inside Yaxley's office during the 2 September, 1997 Ministry infiltration.[1]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 13 (The Muggle-Born Registration Commission)     Ministry of Magic Personnel   Unknown Departments   Annalena Murk ·  Bernie  ·  Bletchley  ·  Pamphlet maker  ·  Cho Chang's mother  ·  Stamford Jorkins  ·  Official No. 39423  ·  Meeting assigner  ·  Lucius Malfoy  · Wakanda  ·  Overweight wizard  · Hector Podmore · Selwyn  ·  Albert Runcorn  ·  Wizard at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup  ·  Balding wizard · Angelica Cole · Squeaky-voiced Ministry of Magic employee · Cassandra Vole's father · Lucas Sparrowvale             Categories         Categories:   British individuals    Males    Ministry of Magic employees    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
