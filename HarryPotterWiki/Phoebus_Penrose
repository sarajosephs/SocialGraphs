He was head of the committee that wrote the report A Study into Muggle Suspicions about Magic.[2]  Contents  1 Behind the scenes 2 Etymology 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Behind the scenes Phoebus was referred to in the Daily Prophet by the title "Professor." He likely had the title for conducting wizarding research and development. However, it is unknown whether he ever taught at Hogwarts, or for another wizarding school. Etymology The name "Phoebus" is the Latinized form of the Greek name Φοιβος (Phoibos), which meant "bright, pure". This was an epithet of the Greek god Apollo.
