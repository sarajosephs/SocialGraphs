Kennilworthy Whisp   Biographical information  Born 1930s or earlier[1]   Nationality English[2]    Physical information  Species Human[2]   Gender Male[2]    Affiliation  Occupation Author[2]Biographical author[2]   Loyalty Wigtown Wanderers[2]   [Source]  Kennilworthy Whisp was an English wizard, author and Quidditch expert/fanatic, known for having written a number of Quidditch-related works, including the best-selling book Quidditch Through the Ages. Whisp resided in Nottinghamshire in England, and divided his time between his home and "wherever the Wigtown Wanderers were playing". His hobbies included playing backgammon, vegetarian cookery, and collecting vintage broomsticks.[2] Despite liking vegetarian cookery, he was not a vegetarian.[3]  Contents  1 Published works 2 Etymology 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Published works Quidditch Through the Ages The Wonder of Wigtown Wanderers He Flew Like a Madman (a biography of "Dangerous" Dai Llewellyn) Beating the Bludgers - A Study of Defensive Strategies in Quidditch Etymology The author's surname may be derived from the Old English word "Wisp", meaning a small bundle of straw (such as might be found at the end of a broom). "Kenilworth" is also the name of a town in Warwickshire, England.  Behind the scenes J. K. Rowling does not think Kennilworthy Whisp and Newton Scamander would be friends.[3] Emily Gravett, the illustrator of Quidditch Through the Ages: Illustrated Edition, used her father as the image for Kennilworthy Whisp in said edition.[4][5] Appearances Quidditch Through the Ages (First appearance) Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (Mentioned in footnotes) LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 (Mentioned only in PSP/Nintendo DS versions) Pottermore (Mentioned only) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) J. K. Rowling's Twitter account (Mentioned only) Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card) Harry Potter: Wizards Unite (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Quidditch Through the Ages was published as early as 1952 so the author would likely have to be born by the mid 1930s.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 Quidditch Through the Ages  ↑ 3.0 3.1 @tylorstarr: Do you think Newt and Kennilworthy are friends? And if so, do they sit around making vegetarian dishes for each other? @jk_rowling: No, I don't think Newt and Kennilworthy would be friends at all. *Very*different kinds of people (and Kennilworthy would definitely eat steak.) by J.K.
