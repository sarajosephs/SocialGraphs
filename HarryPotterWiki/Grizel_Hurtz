She dealt with queries of an emotional nature, while her co-columnists Zamira Gulch, Helbert Spleen, and Dempster Wiggleswade addressed more straightforward issues. On one occasion, Hurtz responded to a letter from a lovelorn witch, who was thinking about using a Love Potion to attract the man whom she loved. Grizel suggested she use a Hate potion instead, to rid herself of her obsession.[2]  Etymology Hurtz is a homophone of the English word hurts. This may be a play on the term "agony aunt", which is a British slang term for a advice columnist.
