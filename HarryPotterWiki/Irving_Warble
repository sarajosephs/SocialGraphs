The name is derived from the River Irvine. Irving Berlin is considered one of the greatest American songwriters; his most popular popular songs include such musical standards as Alexander's Ragtime Band, White Christmas, Happy Holidays, Cheek to Cheek, Let's Face the Music and Dance and Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning. Warble is an English verb meaning "to sing in a high or shaky voice" and is a word often associated with the singing of birds. Behind the scenes The warble flute may be attributed to Irving Warble. The flute was regarded to be developmental to the jazz scene in New Orleans, which Warble was likely alive to see.
