Beedle the Bard   Biographical information  Born c. 15th centuryYorkshire, England, Great Britain   Nationality English    Physical information  Species Human   Gender Male   Hair colour Blonde/green[1]   Eye colour Blue[1]   Skin colour Light[1]    Affiliation  Occupation Author[2]   [Source]    "If his stories accurately reflect his opinions, he rather liked Muggles, whom he regarded as ignorant rather than malevolent; he mistrusted Dark Magic, and he believed that the worst excesses of wizardkind sprang from the all-too-human traits of cruelty, apathy or arrogant misapplication of their own talents. The heroes and heroines who triumph in his stories are not those with the most powerful magic, but rather those who demonstrate the most kindness, common sense, and ingenuity." — J. K. Rowling regarding Beedle[src]  Beedle the Bard (fl. 15th century)[3] was an English wizard and author of wizarding fairytales. Beedle was born in Yorkshire, England. At some point in his life he wrote The Tales of Beedle the Bard. Beedle wrote in ancient runes, which were later translated to English.[2] Taking his stories as an indicator of his opinions, he seemed to have held Muggles in higher esteem than most of his contemporaries. He also valued traits such as kindness, common sense, and ingenuity.[2]  Contents  1 Works 2 Physical appearance 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Works    Beedle the Bard writing stories   The Tales of Beedle the Bard consisted of at least the following tales:  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot[4] The Fountain of Fair Fortune[5] The Warlock's Hairy Heart[6] Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump[7] The Tale of the Three Brothers[8][9] Physical appearance A woodcut of Beedle shows him with a "luxuriant" beard.
