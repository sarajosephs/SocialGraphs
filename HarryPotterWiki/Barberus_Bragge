He was responsible for the introduction of the Golden Snidget into Cuaditch, thus changing the face of Quidditch forever.[1] For this, he was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card.[2]  Contents  1 Biography  1.1 Early life 1.2 As Chief of the Wizards' Council   2 Appearances 3 Notes and references   Biography Early life Bragge was most likely born between the mid to late-twelfth century and the early-thirteenth century. He presumably attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth, like so many other wizards before him.  As Chief of the Wizards' Council During a Cuaditch (period-Quidditch) game in 1269, Chief Bragge released a Golden Snidget onto the field, and offered the player who captured it one-hundred and fifty Galleons. In protest, the witch Modesty Rabnott summoned the Snidget to her and fled the game. Bragge was furious and was almost going to hex her, when his advisors calmed him down and she was fined ten Galleons for disrupting the game. However, the idea caught on, and soon the Snidget was a part of the game, with a new player, the Hunter (Seeker), being added to the team.[1]  Appearances Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card) Quidditch Through the Ages (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 Quidditch Through the Ages, Chapter 4 (The Arrival of the Golden Snitch)  ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)        Preceded by:Unknown  Chief of the Wizards' Councilc. 1269  Succeeded by:Unknown, eventually Burdock Muldoon           Chocolate Frog Cards     Gold cards   Armando Dippet · Albus Dumbledore · Barberus Bragge · Bertie Bott · Carlotta Pinkstone · Dzou Yen · Falco Aesalon · Godric Gryffindor · Harry Potter · Herpo the Foul · Helga Hufflepuff · Montague Knightley · Phillipus von Hohenheim · Rowena Ravenclaw · Salazar Slytherin    Silver cards   Alberic Grunnion · Alberta Toothill · Andros the Invincible · Artemisia Lufkin · Blenheim Stalk · Bowman Wright · Chauncey Oldridge · Circe · Cliodna · Crispin Cronk · Cyprian Youdle · Daisy Dodderidge · Derwent Shimpling · Donaghan Tremlett · Dunbar Oglethorpe · Dymphna Furmage · Elfrida Clagg · Felix Summerbee · Fulbert the Fearful · Gaspard Shingleton · Gideon Crumb · Glenda Chittock · Gondoline Oliphant · Gregory the Smarmy · Gwenog Jones · Honoria Nutcombe · Ignatia Wildsmith · Joscelind Wadcock · Kirley Duke · Laverne de Montmorency · Leopoldina Smethwyck · Maeve · Mirabella Plunkett · Mopsus · Morgan le Fay · Oswald Beamish · Roderick Plumpton · Sacharissa Tugwood · Thaddeus Thurkell · Wendelin the Weird · Xavier Rastrick    Bronze cards   Adalbert Waffling · Almeric Sawbridge · Archibald Alderton · Balfour Blane · Beatrix Bloxam · Beaumont Marjoribanks · Bridget Wenlock · Burdock Muldoon · Cassandra Vablatsky · Celestina Warbeck · Cornelius Agrippa · Devlin Whitehorn · Dorcas Wellbeloved · Edgar Stroulger · Elladora Ketteridge · Ethelred the Ever-Ready · Flavius Belby · Gifford Ollerton · Glanmore Peakes · Glover Hipworth · Greta Catchlove · Grogan Stump · Gulliver Pokeby · Gunhilda de Gorsemoor · Havelock Sweeting · Hengist of Woodcroft · Heathcote Barbary · Herman Wintringham · Hesper Starkey · Jocunda Sykes · Justus Pilliwickle · Merlin · Merton Graves · Merwyn the Malicious · Miranda Goshawk · Mungo Bonham · Musidora Barkwith · Myron Wagtail · Newton Scamander · Norvel Twonk · Orsino Thruston · Perpetua Fancourt · Quong Po · Roland Kegg · Stoddard Withers · Tilly Toke · Uric the Oddball · Yardley Platt    Famous Vampires cards   Blodwyn Bludd · Vlad Drakul · Amarillo Lestoat · Carmilla Sanguina · Herbert Varney    Famous Hags cards   Babayaga · Malodora Grymm · Old Mother Hubbard · Cordelia Misericordia · Leticia Somnolens    Famous Giants cards   Bran the Bloodthirsty · Cyclops · Goliath · Morholt · Hengist of Upper Barnton    Famous Goblins cards   Alguff the Awful · Eargit the Ugly · Gringott · Ug the Unreliable · Urg the Unclean    Dragon cards   Common Welsh Green · Hebridean Black · Hungarian Horntail · Norwegian Ridgeback · Romanian Longhorn    Beast cards   Billywig · Bowtruckle · Doxy · Double-ended Newt · Giant Purple Toad · Giant Squid · Gnome · Gytrash · Imp · Kelpie · Manticore · Mountain Troll · Streeler · Phoenix · Unicorn              Categories         Categories:   British individuals    Gold Chocolate Frog Cards    Historical figures    Males    Wizards    Wizards' Council             Languages      Deutsch Español Suomi Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
