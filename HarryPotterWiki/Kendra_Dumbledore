She was also the mother of Albus, Aberforth, and Ariana Dumbledore. When her daughter Ariana was fourteen years old she lost control of her magic, causing an explosion that killed Kendra,[7] as she had become an Obscurus.[6] After her death, Albus (her oldest son) was left to care for Aberforth and Ariana, as Percival was in Azkaban.

Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise —" Elphias Doge: "She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman." — Muriel gossiping about the Dumbledores[src]  After her daughter, Ariana, was attacked by Muggle boys who saw her perform magic, Kendra moved the family to Godric's Hollow, while her husband was imprisoned in Azkaban for taking revenge upon the Muggles who hurt Ariana. He did not reveal his reasons to the Ministry of Magic, and both he and Kendra kept the attack a secret, out of fear that Ariana would be considered a threat to the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy and confined to St Mungo's, as the attack left the young witch mentally disturbed and unable to control her magic. While her husband was imprisoned and her sons attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Kendra took care of Ariana. Rumours, spread by people such as Muriel and her cousin Lancelot, suggested that Kendra was keeping her "Squib" daughter locked up in a cellar. When Ariana was fourteen years old, she lost control of her magic, and the explosion she caused killed Kendra.[7] After Kendra's death, the cause of which "nobody ever seemed sure" (according to Muriel), Ariana was taken care of by her older brother Albus. She was eventually killed in a three-way duel between Albus, Aberforth, and Gellert Grindelwald.  Physical appearance Kendra had jet black hair which she tended to wear in a high bun, dark eyes, high cheekbones, and a straight nose. Harry Potter, upon seeing a photograph of her, thought she looked Native American, possibly indicating her heritage. He also thought her face had a "carved quality", and noted her expression as being "formally composed".  Personality and traits  "I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up..." — The manner in which Kendra raised her children[src]  Little is known about Kendra Dumbledore, but much was said about her in gossip. Muriel deemed her a proud, terrifying woman who cared a great deal for her reputation and pretended not to be Muggle-born, apparently aspiring to higher social status; Muriel also stated that she was ashamed by her "Squib" daughter Ariana and she kept her locked in a cellar. However, Muriel gossiped maliciously about many people, thus her opinion was not necessarily reliable. Elphias Doge, a good and close friend of her son Albus, described Kendra as a "fine woman", implying she was of good nature and had deep love for her family.  Statements made by her son Aberforth Dumbledore suggest that Kendra made keeping the secret of her daughter's condition her priority, and was strict with her children about following her example. She seems to have kept herself isolated from other people. Given her manner of death and Aberforth's claim that he was able to get Ariana to eat and to calm down when Kendra could not, she may have had a difficult relationship with her daughter, as well as her sons.  Relationships Family  "...my father went after the bastards that did it, and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St Mungo's for good... We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy." — The Dumbledore family's latter life[src]    Ariana, her only daughter, who she and her husband gave up everything to protect   Kendra was devastated by her daughter's attack. Percival Dumbledore, her husband, retaliated against the Muggle boys who assaulted Ariana, and was sent to Azkaban. He never told the Ministry of Magic his reasons, knowing that if her condition were discovered, Ariana would be permanently confined to St Mungo's as a threat to the Statute of Secrecy. To maintain this secrecy, Kendra moved her family to Godric's Hollow and looked after Ariana. However, while Ariana's brother Aberforth was the only one able to keep her calm, the fact that Kendra was able to live alone with Ariana while Aberforth was away at school implies that Kendra and Ariana bore a close mother-daughter relationship. Eventually, Ariana accidentally killed her mother in an explosion of uncontrollable magic.[8]     Albus and Aberforth, her sons   Kendra's relationship with her two sons, Albus and Aberforth Dumbledore, is largely unknown. She read The Warlock's Hairy Heart from The Tales of Beedle the Bard to Albus at least, implying she at least tried to have a good relationship with them. However, while he was devastated by his mother's death, Aberforth resented her secretive nature and bitterly stated that they only learnt lies and secrets from her and that they were better off, though he evidently still loved her a lot. When Albus looked into the Mirror of Erised, he saw his family alive and whole, showing that even if Kendra's relationship with Albus was not so good, although it can be assumed to be better than the one she had with Aberforth and despite being bitter at her mother for dying and leaving him as head of the family, Albus still loved her truly.  Etymology Kendra is a name of disputed origin. It may come from Anglo-Saxon meaning "understanding, knowledge". It may be a variation of the English name Kenda, meaning "water baby", or Dakota, meaning "magical power". Alternatively, it may come from the name Kendrick, which is either derived from Welsh for "greatest champion" or Anglo-Saxon for "family ruler". Behind the scenes Harry Potter Film Wizardry and the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 incorrectly states Kendra's death date as 18 November. In a The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore prop for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Kendra's name is poorly transcribed as "Canard".[9] The epitaph on Kendra and Ariana Dumbledore's gravestone, which was made of granite, as recorded in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is Matthew 6:21 from the Christian Bible: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." This epitaph, chosen by Albus Dumbledore, is curiously similar to the function of one of Albus's inventions, the Deluminator. If Kendra was in fact Native American, she may have studied magic at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Marie Jackson playing Kendra was supposed to make Kendra's first in-person appearance in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, but her scenes were deleted.[10] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 4 images related to Kendra Dumbledore.
