I’d personally stopped him strangling two referees. However, I had no suspicion about what he was planning to do if the final didn’t go our way. I mean, who’d suspect that? You’d have to be as mental as he was." — Ivan Popa[src]  Niko Nenad (d. 1809)[1] was a Romanian wizard who played as a Beater for the Romanian National Quidditch team in the early 19th century.[1] He was described as an extremely volatile and unstable man, with a habit of injuring himself.[1]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Biography    Niko Nenad's foot set alight   Nenad was an extremely volatile and unstable man. During the quarter- and semi-finals of the 1809 Quidditch World Cup, the other players on the Romanian team witnessed him knock himself over the head with his own broom, and set his feet on fire out of frustration. Ivan Popa had to intervene twice when he tried to strangle two different referees. His teammates became so concerned with his behaviour that they tried to convince the team's manager to replace him with another player for the final — which was to be played between Romania and New Spain on the West Siberian Plain — but he chose not to listen.[1] Prior to the final, Nenad jinxed the whole of the forest adjacent to the pitch, handsomely paying local Siberian Dark Wizards to help him carry out the job, and possibly also calling upon less-principled fans. Two hours into the game, when New Spain were ahead on points and Romania were exhausted, Nenad deliberately sent a Bludger flying into the forest. The trees instantly sprang to life and proceeded to attack the stadium, resulting in several injuries and deaths. Nenad was killed early in the carnage by a "particularly violent" spruce.[1]  Magical abilities and skills Flying: Nenad played as Beater in his lifetime for the Romanian National Quidditch team, showing he was an accomplished flyer and Quidditch player, despite his extremely violent behaviour displayed on the pitch.[1] Charms: Nenad had some skills in the casting of charms, as he was able to set his feet alight in a furious temper with the Fire-Making Spell.[1] Dark Arts: Nenad was capable of animating an entire forest with a jinx, with the help of Siberian Dark Wizards, showing he was skilled with dark magic and with the casting of Dark charm.[1] Appearances Pottermore (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.12 1.13 1.14 History of the Quidditch World Cup from  Pottermore (via The Internet Archive)     Quidditch positions      Keeper   Raul Almeida · Ralph Heidelberger · Jonny Nuhaka · Lev Zograf · Denison Frisby · Bastien Janvier · Hermann Wiel · Barry Ryan · Tamotsu Iwamoto · Darren O'Hare · Martin Helstrom · Oliver Wood · Sendelina de la Felino · Merwyn Finwick  ·  Parkin · Grenouille · Kquewanda Bailey · Lenelle Paraison · Lachlan MacKenzie   Chaser   Alejandra Alonso · Fernando Diaz · Gonçalo Flores · Debbie Muntz · Gianni Fedele · Robert Green · Kenneth Hastings · Maria Monteith · Matthew Echunga · Unidentified Ballycastle Bats Chaser · Alexei Levski · Clara Ivanova · Vasily Dimitrov · Dragomir Gorgovitch · Avery Hawksworth · Edric Vosper · Keaton Flitney · Hildegarde Lafarge · Josephine Marat · Mathilde Mallard · Igor Brand · Kursten Blijk · Kurt Todt · Ginny Weasley · Wilda Griffiths · Moran · Mullet · Troy · Noriyuki Sato · Ryotaro Tanaka · Yoshihiro Suzuki · Alasdair Maddock · Fabius Watkins · Lorre Gustafson · Olaf Andersen · Peter Hansen · Ladislaw Zamojski · Catriona McCormack · Ana de Lebron · Carmen Garcia · Chavelle Arbelo Cartaya  ·  Joscelind Wadcock  ·  Petrova Porskoff  ·  Parkin (Chaser I)  ·  Parkin (Chaser II)  ·  Parkin (Chaser III)  ·  Gunhilda Kneen  ·  Radulf  ·  Otmar Frick  ·  Willi Wenzel  ·  Quentin Kowalski · Clairvius Hyppolite · Elodie Dembélé   Beater   Carlos Clodoaldo · Rafael Santos · Greg Ruczinski · Troy Duvall · Kelly Whakkaarangapawarau · Kylie Meadows · Finbar Quigley · Ivan Volkov · Pyotr Vulchanov · Joey Jenkins · Dawn Withey · Indira Choudry · Karl Broadmoor · Kevin Broadmoor · Alain Lacroix · Ninon Saucet · Elena Eldritch · Glockenspieler · Hesser · Katrina von Glockenspieler · Gwenog Jones · Connolly · Quigley · Minaka Hirakata · Keiko Takahashi · Asgard Pettersson · Asgeir Knutsen · Tiago Montoya · Dimitar Draganov · Vasco Santini ·  Parkin (Beater I) · Parkin (Beater II) · Ludo Bagman · Quintia Qarase · Narinder Singh · Ugga · Mercy Ojukwu · Aliko Okoye · Jean-Baptiste Bloncourt   Seeker   Tony Silva · Ariel Singleton · Maximus Brankovitch III · Gregory Cotton · Lucy Karoonda · Viktor Krum · Galvin Gudgeon · Blythe Parkin · Roderick Plumpton · Cybèle Peltier · Konrad Weiss · Josef Wronski · Glynnis Griffiths · Aidan Lynch · Shizuka Watanabe · Eunice Murray · Lennox Campbell · Tina Lundstrom · Benjy Williams · Dougal McBride · Inigo Fuente Marrero · Parkin · Joseph Snuka · Samuel Equiano · Bruno Bruunhart  · Jacques Miskine · Darius Smackhammer · Shanice Higgins · Sylvian Jolicoeur · Luciano Volpi · Wladyslaw Wolfke · Thorsten Pfeffer · Hector Lamont · Badger Picklish III   Unknown position   Arnold Vogler  ·  Adou Sosseh  · John Talisker  · Millie Gudabi  ·  Goodwin Kneen  ·  Dai Llewellyn  · Ethan Parkin · Gwenog             Categories         Categories:   Wizards    1809 deaths    Beaters    Dark wizards    Males    Murderers    Romanian individuals             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
