Would the Ministry of Magic turn a blind eye if I kidnapped my brother’s children and turned them into blood-sucking ferrets? Yours sincerely, Buckley Cooper." — Buckley Cooper's question to the Problem Page of the Daily Prophet.[src]  Buckley Cooper was a wizard who wrote to the Daily Prophet advice page.[1] He had a long-running feud with his brother and wanted to know if the Ministry of Magic would ignore it if he got revenge for the cursed broomstick he had been sent by abducting his brother's children and turning them into vampire ferrets. In his reply, Dempster Wiggleswade warned Cooper not to go through with these actions.[1]  Appearances Daily Prophet Newsletters (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 Daily Prophet Newsletters: 1 June, 1999, Problem Page              Categories         Categories:   British individuals    Cooper family    Males    Wizards             Languages      Polski      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
