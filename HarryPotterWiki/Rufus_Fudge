He joined the Improper Use of Magic Office in February of 1999, but made a tube train vanish for a bet and was suspended for his actions.[2]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology The name "Rufus" is a Roman cognomen which meant "red-haired" in Latin. Several early saints had this name, including one mentioned in one of Paul's epistles in the New Testament. As a nickname it was used by William II Rufus, a king of England, because of his red hair. It came into general use in the English-speaking world after the Protestant Reformation.  Behind the scenes His two names were names of Ministers for Magic,﻿ Rufus and Fudge, the former being his uncle's successors.
