Behind the scenes Roger Malone can been deduced to have been listed as a Ravenclaw on the list of students in a page of J. K. Rowling's notes shown on Harry Potter and Me. However, as two listed Hufflepuffs (Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner) had their houses changed to Ravenclaw in the novels as published, two of those listed as Ravenclaws must have been changed to Hufflepuff. Malone may be one of those whose house was changed. Appearances Harry Potter and Me (First mentioned) Pottermore (Mentioned only) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ "World Exclusive Interview with J K Rowling," South West News Service, 8 July 2000  - "Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland."  ↑ 2.0 2.1 Though his house is unseen on Harry Potter and Me and ungiven on  Pottermore, it is known that the list of students in Harry's year contained five males and five females in each house. Ravenclaw lacks two known males, and Oliver Rivers and Roger Malone are the only males whose houses are ungiven. However Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner (whose houses were initially Hufflepuff) were moved to Ravenclaw, therefore two of the original Ravenclaw students (Stephen Cornfoot, Kevin Entwhistle, Roger Malone and Oliver Rivers) were moved to Hufflepuff.  ↑ Writing by J.
