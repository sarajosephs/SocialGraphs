Reaching Rome at daybreak, Astolfi and McTavish were seen racing toward the finish line at the Colosseum, but at that point, a violent clash broke out between rival fans that had gathered there. During the course of the fight, Astolfi was turned into a chicken, and McTavish was hit with a hex that left his knees back-to-front. The conflict culminated in an explosion that reduced the Colosseum to rubble.[1] Thanks to Orabella Nuttley, who came forward and proceeded to fix a few columns with a spell of her own invention, the Mending Charm, the damage to the Colosseum had been undone by the time that Muggles roused from their beds by the sound of the explosion finally arrived up at the scene. All they found was a few strangely-dressed men attempting to quell Astolfi, who was obviously enraged, and still stuck in the form of a chicken.[1] It can be presumed afterwards, that after the Muggle observers had left, Silvio was untransfigured back into a human.  Magical abilities and skills Flying: Astolfi was a highly accomplished and world-renowned broom flyer, whose talent in flying allowed him to participate in a broom race from Aberdeen to Rome.[1] Appearances Wonderbook: Book of Spells (First appearance) Notes and references   ↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 Wonderbook: Book of Spells              Categories         Categories:   Broom fliers    Historical figures    Italian individuals    Males    Wizards             Languages      Español Français Polski      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
