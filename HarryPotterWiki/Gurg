Usually, the gurg and was usually identified by being the biggest, ugliest, and laziest giant sitting at the bottom of the mountain. In order to be safe in the giants' territory, one had to present a gift to the Gurg, as Rubeus Hagrid and Olympe Maxime did when they visited the giants' colony, acting as envoys on behalf of Albus Dumbledore in 1996. However, this was not a completely safe method, as Golgomath ordered his subordinates to attack Hagrid for even setting foot into his territory, despite the fact that Hagrid came bearing a gift for him. Even though the Gurgs were the leaders, they did not have complete control of their own tribes; other giants may have murdered them for their position.[1]  Known Gurgs Karkus: Karkus was the Gurg of the last remaining 80 giants on Earth. Karkus presided over the effective extinction of their species when his people began fighting and wiping each other out, and his people were forced to live (by wizards) in a dip beside a mountain lake between four extremely high mountains in Russia, leaving them no choice but to stick together for their own protection. He was killed and succeeded by Golgomath.[1] Golgomath: Golgomath was a Giant with the Giant colony in Northern Europe. He favoured the Death Eaters when they came to the colony to persuade the Giants to rejoin Lord Voldemort's forces. Golgomath beheaded Karkus to take his Goblin-made battle helmet and his place as Gurg of the giants during the Second Wizarding War.[1] Appearances Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (First mentioned) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 20 (Hagrid's Tale)     Giants and half-giants   Giant colony   Gurgs: Karkus (Former) ·  Golgomath  Fridwulfa ·  Grawp (Former) · Karkus's wife ·  Group of injured giants (Former)    Other giants   Bran the Bloodthirsty ·  Cyclops ·  Death Eaters' giant army in the First Wizarding War ·  Goliath ·  Grawp's father ·  Hengist of Upper Barnton ·  Morholt ·  Morholt's brother ·  Unidentified giant in The Blind Pig Unidentified giants at the Battle of Hogwarts: I ·  II ·  III ·  IV ·  V    Half-giants   Rubeus Hagrid · Olympe Maxime · Pronk              Categories         Categories:   Giants    Ranks and titles             Languages      Deutsch Español Suomi Français Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
