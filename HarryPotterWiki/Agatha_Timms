Contents  1 Biography 2 Behind the scenes 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography At the Quidditch World Cup in 1994, she bet Ludo Bagman that the match would last a week, wagering 50% co-ownership of her farm.[1] Ludo referred to her as "little Agatha Timms," presumably indicating that she was either diminutive in stature, or much younger than him.[1]  Behind the scenes In the early German translation, Agatha owns an owl farm, in later editions corrected to eel farm. Etymology The name "Agatha" is the Latinized form of the Greek name Αγαθη (Agathe), derived from Greek αγαθος (agathos) meaning "good". Saint Agatha was a 3rd-century martyr from Sicily who was tortured and killed after spurning the advances of a Roman official. The saint was widely revered in the Middle Ages, and her name has been used throughout Christian Europe (in various spellings). The mystery writer Agatha Christie (1890-1976) was a famous modern bearer of this name.
