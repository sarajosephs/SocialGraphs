Badeea Ali is unlocked as friend in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, Year 5, Chapter 4 (Opposite Day), taking place in the 1988–1989 school year. Later, in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, Year 5, Chapter 9 (Dangerous Friends), Rubeus Hagrid states that his birthday is soon. As Hagrid was born on 6 December, this means all chapters in Year 5 up to Chapter 9 must take place at some point between 1 September 1988 and 6 December in the same year.  ↑ Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, Year 5, "THE GREAT HOGWARTS COOK-OFF" Achievement              Categories         Categories:   1895 births    1991 deaths    Artists    Blue-eyed individuals    Chocolate Frog Cards    Females    Wizard of the Month    Wizards             Languages      Deutsch Español Français Italiano Polski Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
