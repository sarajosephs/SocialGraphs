She had an elder sister, Molly, named after the girls' paternal grandmother of the same name.[3] She grew up hearing about Broomstick Regulations and other equally exciting Ministry details from her father.[4]  Contents  1 Etymology 2 Behind the scenes 3 Appearances 4 Notes and references   Etymology Lucy is a name of Latin origin, meaning "light". It is a feminine form of both Lucius and Luke; it is also a vernacular form of Lucia. The feast day of Saint Lucy (fourth century), patroness of sight, is called the Festival of Light in Sweden. Lucy can also be short for Lucille.  Behind the scenes Lucy's first name may be a tribute to Lucy Pevensie, a character from the Chronicles of Narnia, written by one of J.K. Rowling's favourite authors, C.S. Lewis. Appearances J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life (First mentioned) Pottermore (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Victoire is said to be the "eldest" of her Weasley cousins and to be attending Hogwarts in 2017, she cannot have been born before 2000. Thus, to be younger than her, Lucy must have been born some time after May 2nd, 2000.   ↑ Her father was a pure-blood wizard, but her mother's blood status was unknown.  ↑ Times Online - The Unwritten Story of Harry's Friends and Their Children  ↑  Pottermore- Lucy Weasley.
