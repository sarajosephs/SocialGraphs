There were streaks of grey in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows, he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times." — Scrimgeour's outward disposition[src]  Minister Rufus Scrimgeour (d. 1 August, 1997) was a British wizard who was a powerful ranking official in the British Ministry of Magic. He originally joined the Ministry of Magic as an Auror, where he became a hardened veteran, spending most of his life fighting Dark Wizards. Eventually he rose to become Head of the British Auror Office.  During the Second Wizarding War, Scrimgeour was appointed in 1996 to succeed Cornelius Fudge as Minister for Magic, being the third ex-Auror to hold the post.[9] While he appeared to provide a much tougher and resolute stance against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, he made the same mistake of creating the appearance of safety and security, while in truth Scrimgeour's efforts were waning in progress in the war. This policy of giving the appearance of false safety would ultimately cost Scrimgeour his life, as it left the Ministry open to infiltration by the Death Eaters, who used several high-ranking Ministry officials, all of whom had been subverted to their control, to launch a successful coup and bring the Ministry under Voldemort's control. Voldemort, wanting the location of Harry Potter, captured and brutally tortured Scrimgeour, though when Scrimgeour refused to talk, Voldemort murdered him.

I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting Nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?" Cormac McLaggen: "Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was. We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour; this was before he became Minister, obviously —" — Horace Slughorn hosting a small Slug Club luncheon[src]  Rufus Scrimgeour was born (possibly in Scotland[10] or Wales)[11] into the wizarding Scrimgeour family on a date no later than 1968. It was highly likely Scrimgeour attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during his youth, where he would have received his magical education. Scrimgeour joined the Ministry of Magic, and completed a stringent series of character and aptitude tests to join the Auror Office.[12] At some point before he became Minister, Scrimgeour joined Bertie Higgs, Tiberius, and Cormac McLaggen to hunt recreationally for Nogtails in Norfolk.[13]  Head of the Auror Office (1990s–1996)  Remus Lupin: "What were you saying about Scrimgeour?" Nymphadora Tonks: "Oh… yeah… well, we need to be a bit more careful, he's been asking Kingsley and me funny questions..." — Remus and Tonks discussing Scrimgeour[src]  Eventually, after serving as an Auror for some time and having fought Dark Wizards for most of his working life, Scrimgeour rose to the post of Head of the Auror Office, which he occupied at least in the early-to-mid-1990s.[8] In this capacity, Scrimgeour worked alongside John Dawlish, Proudfoot, Savage, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Gawain Robards. When he was the Head of the Auror Office, he often questioned Tonks and Shacklebolt about Sirius Black, as they were in charge of the investigation of his whereabouts after his escape from Azkaban.[8]  As Minister for Magic (1996–1998)  "These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has, perhaps, faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry: we, ever your servants, will continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that seek to take it from you! Your Ministry… remains… strong!" — Scrimgeour makes a speech on the situation of the wizarding world[src]     Scrimgeour gives a speech on "dark times", while Minister for Magic before his death two days later   With Voldemort finally into the open and declaring open war on Britain's wizarding and Muggle communities, it forced the wizarding community to unite and call for Cornelius Fudge's resignation. In the fortnight following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Ministry's acknowledgement of Lord Voldemort's return in June of 1996,[3] Minister Cornelius Fudge was, as The Quibbler went on to report, "chased from his office."[14] Fudge left office in disgrace and was replaced by the ostensibly more proactive Scrimgeour.[3] Gawain Robards replaced Scrimgeour as Head of the Auror Office.[15] Soon after, Scrimgeour made a speech to the Ministry and the Daily Prophet about "dark times", and trying to better protect Britain from dark wizards than the previous year,[16] as the Ministry under Fudge had denied any evidence of Voldemort's return and branded Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter liars for saying the opposite.[8] When Fudge resigned in the summer of 1996, Fudge and Scrimgeour visited the Muggle Prime Minister in his office via the Floo Network, in which Fudge introduced Scrimgeour as his successor. Scrimgeour informed the Muggle Prime Minister of various strange happenings in the country, such as the Junior Minister Herbert Chorley being bewitched with the Imperius Curse, who was subsequently hospitalised at St Mungos. He expressed the belief to the Prime Minister his security needed to be increased by the Ministry of Magic, in order to prevent similar events occurring, and the Prime Minister was also not too happy with two wizards entering his office so abruptly. He and Fudge bid the Prime Minister farewell and promised to keep him updated about ongoing wizarding affairs.[3] Scrimgeour, though seemingly more capable than Fudge, decided to prioritise appearances over truth in his battle against Voldemort. Apparently, Scrimgeour distrusted Albus Dumbledore in a similar way to Fudge before him, as he assigned Auror John Dawlish to follow Dumbledore during his frequent departures from Hogwarts, ultimately resulting in the Auror being jinxed by Dumbledore.[17] He ordered the arrest of Stan Shunpike, a conductor on the Knight Bus, to give the impression that the Ministry was actively seeking and arresting Death Eaters, even though it was apparent to Harry that Shunpike was innocent and merely foolish.[18] He also quarrelled with Albus Dumbledore over the use of Harry Potter, the alleged "Chosen One", as a mascot for the Ministry to "boost morale".[17]  Visit at the Burrow  Rufus Scrimgeour: "Dumbledore's man through and through, aren't you, Potter?" Harry Potter: "Yeah, I am. Glad we straightened that out." — Rufus Scrimgeour regarding Harry Potter's firm loyalty to Albus Dumbledore[src]     Scrimgeour visiting the Burrow in order to speak with Harry Potter   On Christmas Day 1996, which Harry spent at The Burrow in Devon, Scrimgeour came to visit him, accompanied by Percy Weasley, whom he used as a pretext. Scrimgeour took Harry for a walk around the garden, during which he tried to get answers out of Harry about what Dumbledore was doing, and suggested that the Ministry would be grateful if Harry was to visibly align himself with them.  Harry, revolted by the Ministry's hypocrisy, refused further assistance, saying that the new Ministry was as bad in its own way as the old one.[15]  The death of Albus Dumbledore  Rufus Scrimgeour: "I require a private word with you. Also with Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger." Ron Weasley: "Us? Why us?" Rufus Scrimgeour: "I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private. Is there such a place?" Arthur Weasley: "Yes, of course. The, er, sitting room, why don’t you use that?" Rufus Scrimgeour: "You can lead the way. There will be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur." — Rufus Scrimgeour asking to speak to Harry, Ron and Hermione at The Burrow privately[src]      The funeral of Albus Dumbledore   After Dumbledore's death atop the Astronomy Tower, in the summer of 1997, Scrimgeour and a delegation of Ministry officials came for a short stay at Hogwarts Castle, so that they could attend Dumbledore's funeral. Scrimgeour was seated in the front row, with Minerva McGonagall, looking "grave and dignified". After the service, Scrimgeour once more tried to convince Harry Potter to openly support the Ministry's endeavours, and Harry once again refused.[19] Scrimgeour spoke to Harry once more at the Burrow on 31 July, a month after Dumbledore's death, to release the contents of the late wizard's will to Harry, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger, interrupting Harry's birthday party.[5]      Scrimgeour gives the trio Albus Dumbledore's bequests   Scrimgeour appeared to have aged considerably as a result of working to retain control of the wizarding community, which was in a state of open warfare. He had delayed releasing Dumbledore's personal bequests for thirty-one days, under the Decree for Justifiable Confiscation, in order to inspect the items. Scrimgeour bombarded the trio with questions, attempting to discern Dumbledore's intentions, and was highly suspicious of the gifts he had left them: the Deluminator for Ron, a Golden Snitch for Harry, and an original copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard for Hermione. Scrimgeour refused to give Harry Dumbledore's final bequest, Godric Gryffindor's Sword, believing it to be a historical artefact and public property, which Dumbledore therefore had no right to dispose of as he saw fit.[5] When Harry criticised Scrimgeour for wasting his time scrutinising Dumbledore's things, and for covering up the recent escape of dozens of Death Eaters from Azkaban, the two came close to a duel, in spite of Scrimgeour's claim that he in fact sought to work together, in order to fight Voldemort. The arrival of Arthur and Molly Weasley forced Scrimgeour to regain composure and then depart.[5] Scrimgeour correctly guessed that there might be something hidden inside the Golden Snitch, although he never found out what, as Dumbledore had ensured that the Snitch would only open "at the close".  Assassination  "The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming." — Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus reported Scrimgeour's death and the Death Eater coup[src]      An Imperiused Pius Thicknesse, alongside Dolores Umbridge, Albert Runcorn, and Corban Yaxley, introduces the new regime to the Ministry of Magic employees after Scrimgeour's demise   The following day, 1 August, 1997, the Death Eaters staged a successful coup on the Ministry, as they now had agents loyal to them surrounding the Minister, and as such were able to make a successful attempt on his life.[2] Pius Thicknesse, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and several other high-ranking Ministry officials had all been placed under the Imperius Curse.[20] Scrimgeour was captured and brutally tortured by Voldemort for information on Harry Potter's whereabouts. Scrimgeour, having "put up quite a fight" in his final moments, refused to talk despite knowing where Harry was.[21]  Post-mortem and legacy  "Arthur heard a rumour that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it's true, he didn't give you away." — Remus Lupin describing Scrimgeour's last act before his death to Harry, Ron and Hermione[src]  The official line to Scrimgeour's murder was that he resigned. In his place, the Imperiused Thicknesse was appointed as a puppet Minister, allowing Voldemort to take control of the Ministry.[21] During Thicknesse's regime, the Muggle-Born Registration Commission was set up to persecute and imprison Muggle-borns,[21] with Dolores Umbridge as its head,[22] while Harry Potter again became a wanted person, being declared "Undesirable No. 1", wanted for questioning about the death of Albus Dumbledore.[22] Harry, Ron, and Hermione came to respect Scrimgeour after learning of his sacrifice. It is assumed that after Lord Voldemort's defeat, Scrimgeour's assassination was exposed, but the subject is unclear.[21] Given that Scrimgeour went down the same corruption and misguided decisions as Fudge did which eventually allowed Voldemort to ultimately seize power, it is likely that Scrimgeour also became remembered as one of the least effective Ministers of Magic, just as Fudge lost most of his popularity and became known as one of the most disgraced Ministers in history due to his refusal to accept Voldemort's return.  When Harry encountered Dumbledore's spirit in Limbo when rendered unconscious by Voldemort's Killing Curse during the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry pointed to Dumbledore that he could have been a better Minister than either Fudge or Scrimgeour to which Dumbledore disagreed due to believing he could not be trusted with power as a result of his past with Gellert Grindelwald.[23] Only when Harry defeated Voldemort for the final time and when Kingsley Shacklebolt was appointed Minister for Magic afterwards, were the corruption and misguided decisions by both Fudge and Scrimgeour in the Ministry truly undone and peace was restored to the Wizarding World.  Calamity (2019) In 2019, Scrimgeour appeared as a Foundable during the Calamity. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to free him, allowing Scrimgeour to return to his original time.[24]    Rufus Scrimgeour   Physical appearance Scrimgeour was a man with a certain rangy loping grace; he walked with a slight limp, and looked rather like an old lion with grey streaks in his mane of tawny hair and bushy eyebrows. He had keen yellowish eyes and wore wire-rimmed spectacles.[3] He sometimes used a walking stick.[19] With time, the stresses of the failing conflict reached him, and when last seen he appeared badly-shaven, scraggy, and grim.[2]  Personality and traits  Harry Potter: "Is he... Do you think he’s good?" Albus Dumbledore: "An interesting question. He is able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius." Harry Potter: "Yes, but I meant —" Albus Dumbledore: "I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort." — Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter discussing Scrimgeour's attitude and outside disposition as a politician[src]  Scrimgeour was, according to Dumbledore, a "man of action", having fought against Dark Wizards throughout his career as an Auror and climbed ambitiously through the Ministry.[25] He gave an impression of shrewd toughness and was more decisive and forceful than his predecessor, Cornelius Fudge.[3] Scrimgeour did not underestimate Voldemort as much as Fudge did,[25] which he demonstrated by taking more action for the Wizarding World to fight Voldemort and the Death Eaters, and cared a great deal about the Ministry's reputation. However, despite appearing more proactive, Scrimgeour appeared to be a selfish individual and possessed a more hypocritical, deceitful and shameless side as even though he took more action against Voldemort than Fudge did, he prioritised appearances over truth and cared more for the Ministry's reputation than the safety of the wizarding community, just as his predecessor had done. As a result of his selfishness, he did not allow the reporting of devastating events which had occurred such as the death of renowned Auror Alastor Moody and the 1997 mass breakout of Azkaban, due to believing it would cause panic and ruin the Ministry's reputation, and to keep an appearance of false security and safety. At the expense of true justice, he even allowed the arrest of innocent people — such as Stanley Shunpike — just for the slightest suspicion about knowing Voldemort's plans in order to give the impression that the Ministry was making progress in the war, similar to what Bartemius Crouch Senior had done.[15]      Scrimgeour took more action against Voldemort but still made the same mistake as his predecessor in creating false security   This was most likely fueled by a belief that maintaining peace and giving false appearances of progress were important for the Ministry to regain trust from the wizarding community after they unanimously condemned Fudge's tenure as Minister, when in reality it only further endangered the wizarding community by keeping them more oblivious and unprepared of Voldemort's actions and intentions. Due to his own selfishness and corrupt nature, Scrimgeour also appeared ignorant of corruption within the Ministry, as he was oblivious of Dolores Umbridge's tyrannical crimes during her temporary rule over Hogwarts,[15] and the fact that Pius Thicknesse and other Ministry employees were put under the Imperius Curse to serve Voldemort.[20] Along with his tendency to keep an appearance of false security, this would ultimately prove to be Scrimgeour's undoing.[2]   Scrimgeour: "Remembered you're not at school, have you? Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It's time you learned some respect!" Harry Potter: "It's time you earned it." — An intense row regarding respect and responsibility[src]  Under his shamelessness and hypocrisy, he was also willing to gain the trust of those who the Ministry had previously attempted to discredit in order to keep a false pretence of peace. He tried unsuccessfully at various times to convince Harry Potter to work for the Ministry as a "mascot" to improve morale: once during the Christmas holidays,[15] and another time after Dumbledore's funeral.[19] Harry strongly disliked his hypocrisy and false pretences, claiming Scrimgeour's actions made him just as bad as Bartemius Crouch Senior and Cornelius Fudge.[15] Harry also acknowledged that Scrimgeour honestly cared nothing for his safety, but that he merely wanted him to become a mascot for the Ministry in order to convince the wizarding public he was doing a good job, showing Scrimgeour's selfishness and disregard.[15] Scrimgeour would also become very irate when someone, such as Harry Potter, criticised the Ministry of Magic's actions under his tenure,[15] and demanded others show him the utmost respect at all times, showing he did not take criticism well and held a very high opinion of his position in the wizarding world.[5] Like Severus Snape, he thought of Harry as arrogant and conceited, and disliked him for it,[5] and when Dumbledore refused to accommodate with his intended use of Harry as a mascot or reveal his plans against Voldemort to him, Scrimgeour had a deep distrust of Dumbledore. This distrust resulted in him attempting to spy on Dumbledore,[15] and trying to control the matter of Dumbledore's will after his death rather than prioritising the fight against Voldemort.[5] Despite his flaws, Scrimgeour's redeeming qualities were that he was more courageous and less prejudiced in comparison to Fudge. His less prejudiced nature was shown when he promoted Arthur Weasley, who had long been neglected and shunted sideways by Fudge due to his love for Muggles, to be the Head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects,[26] and also interacted cordially with the Muggle Prime Minister.[3] This demonstrated that unlike Fudge, he did not favour people who were born with high status over those with lower class and also did not put as much importance in blood purity, although promoting Arthur may have also been another unsuccessful attempt to gain Harry's trust. In the end, he proved his bravery and strength of character when he refused, under torture, to tell Voldemort of Harry's whereabouts. This showed that in spite of himself and dislike of Harry, he did not wish for Harry to be killed by Voldemort and was willing to risk his own life in order to protect him and the Ministry from the Dark Lord.[2]  Magical abilities and skills Auror skills: An accomplished wizard, Rufus Scrimgeour was more than proficient in at least Potions, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, and Charms, as all these subjects at Hogwarts are required at both N.E.W.T. and O.W.L. level, at either "Exceeds Expectations" or "Outstanding" level.[27] Given his status as Head Auror, his skill presumably surpassed most of the highly trained Dark Wizard capturers working under him, having fought many Dark Wizard and Witches during his career as an Auror, which displayed his considerable duelling and martial magic abilities, the most essential ability to everyone working in his profession.[25][12] Scrimgeour was also noted to have put up a valiant fight against Lord Voldemort,[21] though it is unknown if this meant his duelling prowess or resilience to torture, although it was likely a combination of both. Nonverbal magic: Scrimgeour was capable of casting spells without speaking their incantations aloud, a highly difficult and advanced magical feat. He non-verbally locked the door of the Muggle Prime Minister's office as well as closing its curtains in 1996,[3] which is an impressive use of magic. Apparition: Like most accomplished adult wizards, Scrimgeour was capable of apparating at will.[28] Charms: Scrimgeour was capable of producing a non-corporeal Patronus Charm,[6] a mark of superior magical ability and talent, given the immense difficulty of performing the charm. Furthermore, he would have needed both an O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. in the subject,[27] showing his accomplishment in this field. He was also capable of using the Locking Spell to lock the door to the Muggle Prime Minister's office as well as closing the office's curtains both non-verbally, which is further testament to his magical skills.[3] Leadership skills: Scrimgeour obviously had the necessary skills of leadership as the wizarding community together called for Scrimgeour to become Minister for Magic to take control over the Second Wizarding War.[3][25] A tried and tested veteran, his skill and competence was both such that he was eventually called upon to head up the Auror Office and command his colleagues, and spearheaded their efforts to round up Dark witches and wizards.[25] While presumably a very capable leader of combatants, however, he made for a poor politician, and spent his short-lived career as head of state trying to improve public opinion, and put more effort into getting the cooperation of Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter in appeasing the masses than he did focusing on the upcoming war,[15] which would prove to be a mistake that cost him his life.[2] Possessions     Scrimgeour's wand   Wand: Scrimgeour owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, wood and core material. Like most wizards in Great Britain, he likely purchased his wand from Ollivanders in Diagon Alley. He would have wielded his wand throughout his career in the British Ministry of Magic and as Head of the Auror Office.[3] Walking stick: Scrimgeour owned and used a walking stick, which helped ease his limp when he took longer walks or journeys.[15][19] Media Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ( The Will of Albus Dumbledore )The Last Will and Testament of Albus Dumbledore Etymology Rufus is a Latin name meaning "red". It was a Roman cognomen as well as the nickname of King William II of England, who had the reputation for being an effective soldier but a ruthless and unpopular ruler. Scrimgeour is a Scottish surname that is believed to probably mean "skirmish", from the French escrimeur, meaning "swordsman". His name therefore loosely translates to "Red Skirmish" or "Red Swordsman".[29]  Behind the scenes     Rufus Scrimgeour as he appears in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7       Rufus Scrimgeour as he appears in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite   Bill Nighy portrayed Scrimgeour in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.[30] Nighy was originally cast for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince;[31] however, Scrimgeour was cut from that film. Although it is likely Scrimgeour was raised in Scotland, Nighy played the character with a Welsh accent. In the film, Scrimgeour does not sport a mane-like beard, and he doesn't seem to be as tough and ruthless as he is in the book. Due to his being cut in Half-Blood Prince, Scrimgeour's relationship with Dumbledore is not mentioned in the film, and Harry's relationship with him is far from antagonistic. Luna Lovegood once mentioned to Harry Potter that Scrimgeour was a vampire, a story her father was supposed to publish in the magazine The Quibbler. The authenticity of this claim is quite questionable, as The Quibbler has a reputation for publishing unlikely and outrageous stories, although Luna suspects it was confirmed to be true due to Scrimgeour demanding that they not publish the article. Interestingly, Bill Nighy also played Viktor, a vampire in the Underworld series. It is possible that he is related to Brutus Scrimgeour, the author of the book The Beaters' Bible, and a reviewer of the book Quidditch Through the Ages. Scrimgeour shares the same given name as his predecessor's nephew. Although stated in the book Scrimgeour sports glasses, in the film he does not — even though Nighy himself does. In the film adaptations, Scrimgeour's negative personality aspects never come to light in the way and to the extent they do in the book, and he was much more civil and patient in his interactions with the Trio during the reading of Albus Dumbledore's will. Scrimgeour's anti-Death Eater propaganda, particularly the Ministry's attitude towards Stan Shunpike, is similar to Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist ideas during the Second Red Scare in the 1950s. In the books, Scrimgeour protects Harry's whereabouts when the Ministry has fallen. This shows his protection of Harry, even though he has argued with him many times in the books.
