Contents  1 Biography 2 Behind the scenes 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography Prior to the establishment of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she was involved in the training of young wizards and witches in her native Ireland. She was immortalised on a Chocolate Frog Card.[2][3][4]  Behind the scenes Her title may indicate she was Muggle-born or half-blood, as Remus Lupin mentioned there are no princes in the wizarding world[1] and thus, probably no queens or it means that she married a Muggle king. Etymology The name "Maeve" is the anglicised form of the Gaelic name Medb meaning "intoxicating". In Irish legend this was the name of a warrior queen of Connacht. Her fight against Ulster and the hero Cúchulainn is told in the Irish epic 'The Cattle Raid of Cooley'.  Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 3 images related to Maeve.
