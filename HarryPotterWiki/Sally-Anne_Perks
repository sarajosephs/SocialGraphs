However, she may be the unidentified bespectacled girl or one of the unnamed Gryffindor girls in Harry's year, in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film). It is also possible that she was one of the two un-named Hufflepuff girls in Harry's year, since only Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott and Megan Jones were mentioned to be sorted into Hufflepuff. Sally-Anne Perks was not called to take her test for a practical examination in the 1996 O.W.L.s. Her turn should have come after the Patil twins but before Harry Potter. This could just be a mistake of J. K. Rowling, or Sally-Anne may have been unable to attend her test. She could also have repeated one or more years, which would make her a fourth or younger year while Harry was in his fifth year. The option for Perks as a family name for the protagonist of Fantastic Beasts: Cases from the Wizarding World suggests Sally-Anne may have been a half-blood or a pure-blood.
