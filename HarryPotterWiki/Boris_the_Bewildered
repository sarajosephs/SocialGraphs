Boris the Bewildered   Biographical information  Died Before 1995[1]    Physical information  Species Human[2]   Gender Male[2]   Hair colour Black[3]   Skin colour White[3]    Affiliation  Loyalty Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry[2][3]   [Source]  Boris the Bewildered[2][3] was a wizard from an unknown time period.   Contents  1 History 2 Behind the scenes 3 Etymology 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   History A statue of him stood on the fifth floor of Hogwarts Castle, near the Prefects' bathroom. His statue featured a lost-looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands.[2] A portrait of Boris also hung on Hogwarts' walls, guarding a secret passageway between the second floor corridor and the third floor corridor. The password was Forget-Me-Never.[3]  Behind the scenes Boris died sometime prior to 1995, as portraits hung at Hogwarts depict deceased individuals.[1] Etymology "Boris" is from the Turkic name Bogoris, perhaps meaning "short" or "wolf".
