While Jacob Kowalski was under the influence of an Entrancing Enchantment cast by Queenie Goldstein, he thought the name 'Tolliver' was amusing.[2]  Biography In 1927, he was dating fellow Auror Tina Goldstein.[2]  Appearances Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay (First appearance) Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (Mentioned only) The Archive of Magic: The Film Wizardry of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Judging on Porpentina's age and graduating from school, it is likely he was born around this time.  ↑ 2.0 2.1 Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay, Scene 36     Magical Congress of the United States of America      Presidents   Josiah Jackson (1693-?) ·  Charity Wilkinson ·  Thornton Harkaway (c. 1760) ·  Able Fleming ·  Elizabeth McGilliguddy (c. 1777) · Emily Rappaport (c. 1790) ·  Seraphina Picquery (1920-1928) ·  Samuel G.
