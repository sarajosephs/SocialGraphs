Grindelwald: "I know he can. But will you be with us when that happens, Krall? Will you?" — Gellert Grindelwald detecting Krall's disloyalty[src]  Krall was a wizard who lived during the early 20th century. He was a member of Gellert Grindelwald's Alliance, and was among the dark wizard's foremost acolytes. In 1927, he accompanied his master to Paris and aided his efforts to recruit Credence Barebone, but perished there when his dedication to Grindelwald's cause proved inadequate.[1]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Personality and traits 3 Relationships  3.1 Gellert Grindelwald   4 Etymology 5 Behind the scenes 6 Appearances 7 Notes and references   Biography Krall became a supporter of Gellert Grindelwald at some point prior to 1927 and became one of his acolytes. He travelled to Paris to help further Grindelwald's plans, where he expressed doubt that Credence Barebone was a match for Albus Dumbledore. Grindelwald bluntly asked him if he would stand by his side, and while Krall hastily confirmed he would, Grindelwald looked unconvinced of his honesty.     Krall dies in the flames   Krall attended Grindelwald's rally at the Lestrange family Mausoleum in the Cimetière du Père-Lachaise. He was indirectly killed by his own master in 1927 when he failed to cross enchanted fire that tested one's loyalty.[1]  Personality and traits Krall was described as being "sulky" and "ambitious".[2] Despite siding with Grindelwald when he rose to power throughout the wizarding world, Krall was conflicted and disillusioned with his decision, to an extent. His moral struggle did not go unnoticed by his master. When push came to shove, Krall's morals outweighed his lust for power, leading to his death in Grindelwald's fire.  Relationships Gellert Grindelwald    Gellert Grindelwald, his former master and killer   Krall was initially loyal to Gellert Grindelwald, who once trusted him enough to include him among one of his acolytes. However, at some point, his loyalty had began to waver. Sensing this, Grindelwald had no qualms confronting him over it, bluntly asking whether he would stand by him as he collected Credence to use against Albus Dumbledore and not looking convinced when Krall tried to assure him. Ultimately, Krall died when crossing Grindelwald's Protego Diabolica due to his inadequate loyalty.  Etymology In a few Slavic languages, kral means "king", derived from the given name "Karl" (itself derived from Old Norse karl, "free man"), i. e. Charlemagne. In Westrobothnian, it means "insects" or "that which crawls" Kraal is an Afrikaans and Dutch word for an enclosure for cattle or other livestock surrounded by a fence of thorn-bush branches, a palisade, mud wall, or other fencing, roughly circular in form. It stems from the Portuguese curral, found in English as corral. "Kralle" is German and means "claw" or "talon", possibly alluding to Krall's role as a henchman. Behind the scenes Krall was portrayed by David Sakurai in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.[2][3] Appearances Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay (First appearance) Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald The Archive of Magic: The Film Wizardry of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald Pottermore (Mentioned only) Wizarding World (Mentioned only) Harry Potter: Magic Awakened (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay, Scene 114  ↑ 2.0 2.1 ‘Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them’ Sequel Adds David Sakurai at Deadline.com  ↑ Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald IMDb page     The Alliance   Leader  Gellert Grindelwald     Acolytes  Abernathy | Credence Barebone (defected) | Carrow | Queenie Goldstein (defected) | Krafft | Krall (deceased) | MacDuff | Nagel | Vinda Rosier | Zabini   Followers  Cassius Bell | Gunnar Grimmson | Helmut | Karl | Anton Vogel | Henrietta Fischer   Headquarters  Unidentified home | Nurmengard             Categories         Categories:   Deaths by fire    Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally fatalities    Killed by Gellert Grindelwald    Males    Members of the Alliance    Murder victims             Languages      Deutsch Deutsch Español Français Polski Português do Brasil Русский      *Disclosure: Some of the links above are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, Fandom will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.
