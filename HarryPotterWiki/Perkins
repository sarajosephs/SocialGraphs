Thank goodness, I didn’t know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not. I've just sent an owl to your home but you've obviously missed it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago!" Arthur Weasley: "I know about the regurgitating toilet." Perkins: "No, no, it's not the toilet, it's the Potter boy's hearing — they've changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o'clock now and it's down in the old Courtroom Ten!" — Perkins informing Arthur that the time of Harry Potter's hearing had been changed[src]  Perkins (fl. 1975 - 1998) was a British warlock who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, as a subordinate of Arthur Weasley, who was head of the office.[2]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Physical appearance 3 Magical abilities and skills 4 Possessions 5 Etymology 6 Behind the scenes 7 Appearances 8 Notes and references   Biography During the Quidditch World Cup in 1994, Perkins lent his supervisor, Arthur Weasley, a tent so he and his family could camp out after the match. Perkins allowed the Weasleys to keep the tent after his lumbago got worse and he no longer had any interest in camping.[3] His tent would later be used by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger during their search for Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes.[4] Perkins met Harry Potter in 1995 when the boy was summoned before the Wizengamot to answer a charge of using magic in front of a Muggle.[2] In 1997, he attended the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour.[5]  Physical appearance He was described as being an elderly wizard who had fluffy white hair.[2]  Magical abilities and skills Charms: As part of his career duties as an employee for the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, Perkins often had to use the Memory Charm to erase the memories of unsuspecting Muggles who had witnessed magic.[1] Possessions Tent: Perkins owned a tent which was charmed to be magically enlarged. Perkins lent his tent to Arthur Weasley to use for the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.[3] Etymology Perkins is an English surname meaning "son of little Peter".[6]  Behind the scenes Professor Binns once erroneously called Harry Potter "Perkins". In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix it is Kingsley Shacklebolt instead of Perkins who tells Arthur Weasley that the time and venue of Harry Potter's hearing had been changed.  In the German version of the fourth book, Perkins was incorrectly referred to as Mrs Perkins.
