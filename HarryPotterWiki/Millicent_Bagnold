In her youth, she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she was Sorted into Ravenclaw house.[5]  As Minister for Magic (1980-1990)  "Famous Ravenclaw Ministers for Magic include Millicent Bagnold, who was in power on the night that Harry Potter survived the Dark Lord's curse, and defended the wizarding celebrations all over Britain with the words, 'I assert our inalienable right to party'." — Robert Hilliard[src]  In 1980, at the height of the First Wizarding War, Bagnold rose to the position of Minister for Magic of Great Britain.[6] Bartemius Crouch Snr was Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement during Ms Bagnold's term.[7] She was in power when, on the evening of 31 October, 1981, Lord Voldemort led an attack in Godric's Hollow that resulted in the murders of James and Lily Potter, the destruction of Voldemort's corporeal body, as well as the inadvertent creation of a Horcrux, Harry Potter. The night that followed turned out to be the major upheaval of Bagnold's term in office since wizards up and down the country started celebrating Voldemort's downfall and the end of the First Wizarding War in what became "a night of large-scale breaches of the International Wizarding Statute of Secrecy"[6][8] Bagnold defended these celebrations by famously stating that she asserted the wizards' "inalienable right to party."[5]     The Death Eater trials before the Council of Magical Law   It was also during her term in office that Death Eaters Igor Karkaroff, Rodolphus, Rabastan, Bellatrix Lestrange, as well as Bartemius Crouch Jnr were rounded up and tried before the Council of Magical Law and sent to Azkaban.[9] Sirius Black was falsely accused to be one of Voldemort's supporters and one of those responsible for the murders of James and Lily Potter and was sent to Azkaban without a trial.[7] After Bagnold's retirement in 1990, it was temporarily unclear who would succeed her. In the early 1980s, Bartemius Crouch Snr was very likely to succeed Bagnold, but his popularity was tarnished after the scandal in which he sent his own son to Azkaban.[7] Albus Dumbledore also had a lot of popular support to be her successor, but he never expressed any desire to take the Minister's job, so Cornelius Fudge took the post instead.[10][11]  Later life On 1 September, 1991, Prefect Robert Hilliard welcomed the Ravenclaw first-years to Ravenclaw Tower with a short speech in which he mentioned former Minister Millicent Bagnold as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been Sorted, like them, into Ravenclaw.[5] In the spring of 2021, as The Unforgivable were seemingly harvesting Harry Potter's traumatic memories to manifest as surges of the Calamity, snippets of their own memories started to leak through to Harry as dreams. At one point, he started having recurring nightmares of Millicent Bagnold presiding over a Wizengamot trial, accusing someone of having a Death Eater for a brother and half of their family in Azkaban for killing Muggles and conspiring with Voldemort. Hermione Granger reached out to Bagnold but she said she presided over many such trials as Minister and could not recall any specific details: Hermione speculated that Bagnold's memory of that day might have been tampered with, but ultimately found it more likely "that her age [had] caught up with her".[12]  Behind the scenes Bagnold's term in office was almost the same as Muggle Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's (1979-1990). She shares the same first name and last initial as Hogwarts Slytherin student Millicent Bulstrode. Millicent was the Minister for Magic during the events of Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery until Cornelius Fudge took over the job during the player's seventh year. Etymology The name "Millicent" is from the Germanic name Amalasuintha, composed of the elements amal "work, labour" and swinþ "strength". Her last name is probably derived from the English author and playwright Enid Bagnold. Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 1 image related to Millicent Bagnold.
