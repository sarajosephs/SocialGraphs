She has two other siblings, Victoire and Louis Weasley.[2] It is possible that Dominique lived at Shell Cottage.  Etymology Dominique is the French feminine form of the masculine name Dominic, derived from the Late Latin Dominicus, meaning "of the Lord". It was traditionally given to a child born on Sunday in Catholic countries.[3] It is also the name of a popular French song by Soeur Sourire, the Belgian "Singing Nun", about Saint Dominic and his fight against the Albigensians.  Appearances J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life (First mentioned) Pottermore (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ Although it has never been confirmed that Septimus and Cedrella are Arthur's parents, this can be inferred based on Sirius Black's statement in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 6 (The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black) that Arthur was "something like [his] second cousin once removed." The Black family tree establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both Orion and Walburga Black, Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree as both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown.
