Most guys think what you was thinking, first time they see me." — Queenie regarding her own physical appearance[src]  Queenie Goldstein[9] (b. 6 January, 1903)[1] was an American half-blood[2] witch[10] and the younger sister of Tina Goldstein. She attended Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she was sorted into Pukwudgie house. After graduating from Ilvermorny, Queenie acquired a desk job in the Wand Permit Office,[11] within the Magical Congress of the United States of America. Because of her beauty, she was described by others as being a "bombshell". She was also an extremely accomplished Legilimens, someone with the ability to extract feelings and memories from another's mind. While initially on the same side as her sister Tina and friend, later brother-in-law Newt Scamander, Queenie was ultimately swayed to join Gellert Grindelwald's side with the offer to be free to love and marry her No-Maj boyfriend Jacob Kowalski, as well as the offer to provide his freedom to others. Queenie later betrayed Grindelwald to help Newt expose Grindelwald's plot to become Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. Queenie subsequently married Jacob and rejoined the side of good.

Still, Queenie insisted that Tina was the career girl, not her, as she "spends most days making coffee or unjinxing the john."[7][19][20][21]  Global wizarding war Making new friends In 1926,[21] Queenie was sharing a brownstone at 679 West 24th Street in New York City with her sister[19][15][22] when the pair were introduced to the soon-to-be-famous British magizoologist and author Newt Scamander and No-Maj Jacob Kowalski. She took quite a liking to Jacob, as he was the first No-Maj she had ever had a decent conversation with (even if most of them were read by her). She was rather upset when she and Tina found that the men had left with the suitcase in the middle of the night, especially after she made them cocoa. The next day, while bringing coffee to a meeting room, she suddenly dropped the tray, breaking the glasses, when she realised Tina was to be executed. Whether it was by instinct or her Legilimency, she knew the danger Tina was in, as well as Newt.      Queenie helping Jacob escape a MACUSA guard   While on her way to find Tina, she spotted Jacob being escorted by Sam, an Obliviator. She originally offered to "obliviate" Jacob because someone called for Sam, but he caught her bluff, as that wasn't part of her department. Queenie then resorted to blackmail, threatening to tell Cecily that he's been seeing Ruby. Hastily, Sam left, leaving Queenie with Jacob. The two managed to break into Graves' office and retrieved Newt's suitcase and his and Tina's wands. When they finally caught up to an escaped Newt and Tina, Queenie ordered all three of them to get into the case. As she was the only one of them who wasn't wanted, she safely smuggled them and the suitcase out of MACUSA, with the excuse that she was heading home because she felt ill. When her supervisor Abernathy asked what the suitcase was for, she told him it was "lady things" and he questioned her no further.      Queenie and Jacob inside The Blind Pig   After regrouping and devising a plan, the group headed for The Blind Pig. Before they gained entry, Queenie and Tina used magic to make them look more presentable for the speakeasy. When they entered, Queenie and Jacob shared some gigglewater, while Newt and Tina negotiated with Gnarlak. After he revealed a possible creature located near Macy's, the MACUSA showed up, revealing Gnarlak's betrayal. Queenie noted that the wanted signs behind her changed to the faces of Newt and Tina. She was delighted when she witnessed Jacob knock out Gnarlak. The group than Apparated away. When they arrived at Ginzberg Delaunay, they spotted the Demiguise, who eventually led them to the storeroom, where an escaped Occamy, immense in size, had been residing. Queenie slowly approached the creature but accidentally kicked a Christmas ornament, disturbing the Occamy. Terrified, she and Jacob looked for cover as it attacked. The group then tried to find an insect and a teapot, as Newt ordered. While looking, Queenie was knocked down by the Occamy. She then watched as Jacob threw a cockroach into the teapot that Tina found, and the Occamy flew directly into the teapot, shrinking in size, to devour the insect.      Queenie while inside Newt's suitcase notices a picture of Leta Lestrange   Finally, all the creatures were caught and safe. Tina and Queenie marvelled at Newt's suitcase and his creatures. While there, Queenie noticed a picture of Leta Lestrange inside Newt's shed. Through her natural talent for Legilimency, she extracted the story between Leta and Newt despite his discomfort and embarrassment. She told Newt that "she was a taker, you need a giver". When Tina showed up and asked what they were talking about, she said they were talking about school. She then tells Jacob and Newt that she and Tina went to Ilvermorny, while Newt says he went to Hogwarts, which he believes is the best wizarding school. Queenie pronounced such a belief "Hogwash". Before anyone can say anything else, the Thunderbird interrupted, as, according to Newt, he sensed danger.  Obscurial attack on New York City     Queenie and Jacob share a brief, yet passionate kiss   The group then witnessed the Obscurial cause havoc across the city. Newt gave his suitcase to Tina and asked her to watch after his creatures. He then apparated away. Worried for Newt's safety, Tina hastily handed the suitcase to Queenie as she followed Newt through her own apparition. Unable to let her sister go, Queenie was about to repeat the pattern, but she was stopped by Jacob. Although resistant to his pleas, she read his mind and understood what he went through during the war. Eventually, Tina and Newt found Queenie and Jacob after the apparent death of Credence and the arrest of Graves, who was actually revealed by Newt to be Gellert Grindelwald. Queenie pushed through the crowd to hug her sister, relieved to see her sister alive. She then witnessed the breathtaking moment when Frank took the Swooping Evil venom to the raining sky to contaminate the water, therefore Obliviating every No-Maj of the incident. The happy ending is short-lived, however, when they received orders that Jacob had to be Obliviated as well. Queenie tried to convince Jacob to let her go with him, but he refused, thinking that there are other men like him. She strongly disagreed, saying that he was the only one. After the tearful goodbye with the group, Jacob entered the rain. Queenie managed to gently kiss him before he "woke up".  Reunion with Jacob Kowalski     Queenie standing in Jacob's bakery   A few months later, Jacob had opened the successful bakery of his dreams, with pastries that resembled some of the magical creatures he encountered with Newt and the Goldstein sisters. One day, Queenie entered the shop in her usual pink attire, and Jacob's memories were rekindled as he touched his neck where the Murtlap bit him and he smiled. However, the true reason of his memory being restored is because of the venom, which only erases bad memories. Around September 1927, Queenie travelled with Jacob to London to visit Newt. She announced that she and Jacob were engaged and planned to be married. Newt noticed Jacob's odd behaviour and realised he had been enchanted by her, using a powerful love charm. After a brief argument, Queenie agreed, and Newt lifted the spell. Jacob refused to marry her, fearing that she would be punished for marrying a No-Maj.  Joining Grindelwald's army     Queenie in one of the Paris's streets, moments before her life changed forever   Rejected by Jacob, Queenie left for Paris, where her currently estranged sister was researching hints about Credence Barebone's whereabouts. Queenie went to the French Ministry of Magic with her suitcase trying to find her sister but couldn't find the postcard her sister had given to her. Being rejected for the second time, all alone, she soon left lost and distraught, after hearing thoughts of Jacob Kowalski on a street, Vinda Rosier approached the upset Queenie in the rain and came to her help and invited her for tea.[23]      Queenie Goldstein speaking with Vinda Rosier   When Queenie informed she needed to leave, Rosier introduced her to Gellert Grindelwald's ideals, and to Gellert himself. Queenie initially showed a strong hostility towards the dark wizard and even raised her wand to him, but he reassured her he meant no ill will towards her and wished to be her friend. Grindelwald convinced her to join his cause by leveraging over her loving and compassionate nature, hinting that in a world where wizardkind must no longer hide, she would be free to love Jacob and that his wizarding world would have no place for Rappaport's Law.      Queenie joining Grindelwald   As such, Queenie attended Grindelwald's meeting in the Lestrange Mausoleum, giddily hearing about him describing the muggles as merely different, to protect from themselves and not oppress, and told Jacob Kowalski (who was warned of her presence there by Nicolas Flamel) that by joining Grindelwald they could finally be together. Jacob refused, leaving her heartbroken, but she still went away with Grindelwald to Nurmengard Castle, clinging on her hope of a future with Jacob as her husband.      Queenie with Grindelwald at Nurmengard   Once established at Nurmengard, using her skills as a legillimens, she acted as an advisor to Gellert Grindelwald, telling him what Credence Barebone was wanting to hear to join his cause. Due to her loving nature, she would have provided much-needed support and guidance to the confused and broken young wizard. Due to her exceptionally potent gifts in Legilimency, Grindelwald would use her as a something of a spy within his own ranks and ask her what his acolytes had on their mind, though mostly directed at Aurelius Dumbledore.

The walk of the Qilin     Grindelwald's acolytes find Queenie with Jacob   In 1932, she attended the walk of the Qilin, where, remorseful for her decision to join Grindelwald, she tried to convince Jacob to leave, telling him that she couldn't come home as she had made too many mistakes. However, Jacob reassured Queenie of his love for her just before they were captured by a group of Grindelwald's followers led by Vinda Rosier - the very witch who had lured Queenie into Grindelwald's hands originally. When Grindelwald tortured Jacob with the Cruciatus Curse, a horrified Queenie begged for someone to stop him, a plea that was mercifully answered by Vicência Santos, and tended to Jacob with the best she could. She witnessed Grindelwald being exposed by Newt and Aurelius with the help of Bunty Broadacre.[3]  Marrying Jacob     Jacob and Queenie getting married   Now back with Jacob after having decided to do what was right rather than easy, Queenie returned home with him and the two got married in his bakery in New York. Their wedding was attended by several friends, including Newt, Theseus, Eulalie, Bunty and her sister Tina, who had recently been busy with work duties. Albus Dumbledore observed their wedding from outside the shop.[3]  Physical appearance Queenie was a stunning witch with blonde hair.[4] She was noted for her beauty, being described as a "bombshell".[10]  Personality and traits Queenie was a free-spirited, kind-hearted woman.[22] She was very empathetic and skilled in the art of Legilimency, which sometimes affected her relationship with others, but deepened the one she shared with her sister.[21][22][24] She was also considered to be "very brave."[24] Queenie was unperturbed by the prejudice of her fellow wizards towards No-Majs, as ferociously evidenced by her relationship with Jacob Kowalski, and her empathy towards him. Having been sorted into Pukwudgie, Queenie was incredibly kind towards people she realised were in pain or torment, as shown by how she consoled Newt Scamander about his relationship with Leta Lestrange - stating that Leta was a taker, whilst he needed a giver. However, it was ironically Queenie's love and compassion towards others that induced her to join Gellert Grindelwald, who managed to persuade her that under his new world order, she and others would have a newfound freedom to love whomever they wish, since laws like Rappaport's Law would be abolished by him. Moreover, Grindelwald's Seer intention to fight against the future Second World War of the Muggles, appealed to Queenie's peaceful personality. Hence, Queenie agreed with Grindelwald's ideology so much, that she was even willing to stick with Grindelwald after her boyfriend Jacob Kowalski tearfully refused to join her, and sadly accused her new fanaticism as "crazy". While certainly heartbroken at losing Jacob, Queenie not only still believed that she can still have a future with Jacob as her husband but also saw in the importance of the free love cause which she could not yet have for herself, and she thus accompanied Gellert Grindelwald to Nurmengard Castle.  Magical abilities and skills  Newt Scamander: "You're a Legilimens?" Queenie: "Mm. Yeah. But I always have trouble with your kind; Brits. It's the accent." — Queenie discussing her Legilimency talent[src]  Legilimency: Queenie was an extremely accomplished Legilimens, who could relatively easily look deep down into the story of someone if she really wanted to. However, an Occlumens of immense power (like Gellert Grindelwald) was able to fully conceal his true thoughts from her, as Queenie was unable to see through his Percival Graves disguise.[25] Queenie was said to have a natural talent at Legilimency and did not need any training at all.[26] However, she claimed to have "trouble" in controlling it at times, such as when she passively read the thoughts of an emotional Newt Scamander, and when reading the minds of individuals with strong foreign accents in English, such as the British wizards, and the French Vinda Rosier, while the latter two were thinking in English. Moreover, Queenie's Legilimency is not a helpful tool for finding people, since when she notably tried to find Jacob Kowalski's thoughts in Paris after briefly hearing them once, Queenie instead ended up painfully overwhelmed by the thoughts of the many people around her.[27] Indeed; it would seem like her ability in this regard exceeded even Grindelwald's own, as he used her to ensure the loyalty and honesty of his current and prospective supporters by penetrating their minds and passing on her findings rather than doing it himself.[28] Love: Queenie, as a member of the house Pukwudgie, was an extremely loving person, and her immense love and compassion for people was strongly reflected in her magic, given her capability to cast a very powerful love enchantment on her then-boyfriend Jacob Kowalski, possibly an Entrancing Enchantment, in order to persuade him to get engaged as soon as possible, since otherwise Jacob did not wish to legally endanger his beloved by marrying her. Ironically, Queenie would become fanatically loyal to Gellert Grindelwald's cause mainly because the Dark Wizard had skilfully appealed to her feelings of love and compassion, promising to make his For the Greater Good new world order a more compassionate one, and that the horrifying future Second World War of the Muggles would be fought against. Despite being an acolyte of Grindelwald, Queenie was as compassionate as ever towards the Obscurial Aurelius Dumbledore, telling Grindelwald how to best appeal to the troubled young man while at Nurmengard. Defence Against the Dark Arts: Queenie told Newt Scamander and Jacob Kowalski that her job at MACUSA mainly involved "unjinxing the john" and making coffee. Additionally, when she unknowingly visited Grindelwald's safe house in Paris, she raised her wand to him when suddenly approached by Grindelwald, implying she was confident she could defend herself against the greatest Dark Wizard of the time long enough to escape, most likely with duelling and martial magic, although Grindelwald, who had most likely seen her abilities in defensive magic when he was Percival Graves, did not appear to be threatened by this notion. Charms: Queenie appeared to be very talented at charms, as she not only casually and effortlessly used several household spells in quick succession to set the table for dinner when she and her sister had Newt Scamander and the No-Maj Jacob Kowalski for dinner, but she was also was an expert at preparing food with magic, notably by preparing a strudel with a wave of her wand. Indeed, Queenie's food-related charms were good enough to greatly impress the latter guest, who was himself a highly talented baker. In addition to know some basic opening spells, including the Unlocking Charm and Aberto, she could also cast an Umbrella spell to shield her from the rain laced with Swooping Evil venom when saying goodbye to Jacob. She was also capable of casting a highly potent love enchantment on her boyfriend Jacob Kowalski to bewitch him into proposing, the effects of which had a profound effect on his mental condition, further showing her impressive proficiency for charms-work. Transfiguration: Queenie had some skill in this notably complex branch of magic, notably being able to transfigure her clothing into a dress before entering the Blind Pig speakeasy. Apparition: Queenie, like most adult wizards and witches, was capable of Apparating with relative ease.[29] Wandless and nonverbal magic: Queenie could use Legilimency by merely looking at a person, without speaking the incantation, and without her wand. Moreover, Queenie was also able to prepare a meal for four people in mere moments without uttering a single word. Additionally, she was able to wordlessly transfigure her clothing into a dress. This implies she was a very skilled witch, as both non-verbal and wandless magic were extremely difficult to perform. Queenie also launched, possibly by use of the Oppugno Jinx, a chair at Helmut to aid in Jacob's escape.

It was described as "sexy" and had an Art Deco-inspired design.[30] The handle was in the shape of a shell and made of mother of pearl. Chadwick's Charms: A seven-volume series of Charms textbooks written by Chadwick Boot and used at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Tina and Queenie Goldstein owned these books while living in an apartment together. The Witch's Friend: A monthly American wizarding women's interest magazine that was published in the early 20th century.

Etymology Queenie is an affectionate name derived from the term queen, which is thought to be derived from the Old English word "cwen". Goldstein is an occupational German name and an Ashkenazi Jewish surname, meaning "gold" with Stein being translated to "stone".  Behind the scenes     Queenie Goldstein as as a POP! Vinyl   Queenie is portrayed by Alison Sudol in the Fantastic Beasts film series.[31] It is possible that Queenie's first name originates from Rowling's list of Hogwarts students ("The Original Forty") written early on in the development of the books, some of which never appeared anywhere in the series. One such name is "Queenie Greengrass.", who was later renamed, Daphne. There is a wizard named Quentin Kowalski who may be a descendant of Queenie Goldstein and Jacob Kowalski. Their marriage would have been in violation of Rappaport's Law in the 1920s, but they could have left the country to marry or been married secretly. The law was repealed in 1965, after which Queenie and Jacob would have been free to live openly in the United States of America as husband and wife with their descendants. It is unknown if Queenie decided to change her surname after marrying Jacob Kowalski. It is common for women to take on their husband's surname, but some couples decide to combine their surnames with a hyphen, and some men can and do take on their wives' surnames. J. K. Rowling revealed in a tweet that Anthony Goldstein, a Ravenclaw Hogwarts student first introduced in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was distantly related to Tina and Queenie Goldstein.[32] Appearances The Harry Potter Wiki has 146 images related to Queenie Goldstein.
