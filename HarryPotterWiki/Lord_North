Word leaked out that Lord North believed in wizards, and he was forced to resign after a motion of no confidence.[2]  Behind the scenes In reality, Lord North resigned from Prime Minister after a vote of no confidence resulting from the Siege of Yorktown, which was the decisive battle against the British in the American Revolutionary War. Moreover, he subsequently served as Home Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons (jointly in the latter role with Charles James Fox) in a ministry nominally headed by William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland.
