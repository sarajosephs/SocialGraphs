He doubled as an advice columnist for the Daily Prophet, answering only the questions which related to health, while Grizel Hurtz, Zamira Gulch, and Dempster Wiggleswade handled other topics.[2]  Contents  1 Biography 2 Magical abilities and skills 3 Behind the scenes 4 Appearances 5 Notes and references   Biography In one issue, Spleen replied to a letter from Howland Coopey, diagnosing him with Dragon Pox based on the symptoms he described.[2] During the Calamity, a Calamity Investigator had a meal with Spleen, who showed them several ways to modify the harvesting, handling and incorporation of Dittany.[3]  Magical abilities and skills Healing magic: Spleen was a professional Healer, meaning he was very accomplished with medical magic, such as with healing spells, potions and other magical remedies.[2] Herbology: Spleen was also skilled with handling and using magical medicinal plants, such as Dittany, to which he showed a Calamity Investigator how to best harvest, handle and utilise the said plant.[3] Behind the scenes The Daily Prophet referred to Spleen by the title "Professor." This may indicate that he once taught at a wizarding school. This can be, however, just an academic title.[2] Appearances Daily Prophet Newsletters (First mentioned) Harry Potter: Wizards Unite (Mentioned only) Notes and references   ↑ As he was employed by St Mungo's by 1999, he was presumably over 17.  ↑ 2.00 2.01 2.02 2.03 2.04 2.05 2.06 2.07 2.08 2.09 2.10 2.11 Daily Prophet Newsletters: 1 June, 1999, Problem Page  ↑ 3.0 3.1 Harry Potter: Wizards Unite     Daily Prophet employees   Editor-in-chief  Barnabas Cuffe  Reporters  A.
