Donaghan became a member of the band, replacing Jacob's sibling, as he could actually play the bass without the use of magic.[7] Donaghan's favourite Quidditch team was the Kenmare Kestrels.[2]  Later life    Donaghan Tremlett playing at the Yule Ball   On Christmas Day in 1994, the band attended the Yule Ball at Hogwarts,[9] where they played classic hits like "Magic Works" and "This Is the Night", as well as a new song titled "Do the Hippogriff".[10] Donaghan married an individual in September 1995. The wedding was mentioned in the Daily Prophet on 7 September.[3]     The Funeral of Albus Dumbledore that Donaghan attended   In June 1997, Donaghan attended the funeral of Albus Dumbledore, and was one of several familiar people Harry Potter noticed among the crowd.[11] After the Ministry of Magic was taken over by Lord Voldemort in September 1997, Donaghan, as a Muggle-born, presumably faced charges before the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. He may have been sent to Azkaban, or else gone into hiding, like many others of his heritage.  Physical appearance Donaghan was described as "hairy"[11] and, like all members of the Weird Sisters, wore "artfully torn" black robes when onstage.[9]  Behind the scenes Donaghan Tremlett was portrayed by Steve Mackey in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Depending on his month of birth, he may have been in the same year as Charles Weasley, Nymphadora Tonks and Jacob's sibling, among others.
